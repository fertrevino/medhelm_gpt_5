The patient's husband states that his family drove across the country to visit them and that his wife 'threatened his parents with a knife' at dinner last night. Police had to be called to calm her down. He states that she has been acting 'really crazy' for the last 9 months, and the initial behavior that caused him alarm was her admission that his deceased sister was talking to her through a decorative piece of ceramic art in the living room. Initially, he thought she was joking, but soon realized her complaints of 'hearing ghosts' talking to her throughout the house were persisting and 'getting worse'. There was also a 4-week period where she experienced insomnia and an unintentional weight loss of 12 pounds. She seemed sad throughout these episodes, and, according to her husband, was complaining of feeling 'worthless'. Her general hygiene has also suffered from her recent lack of motivation and she insists that the 'ghosts' are asking her to kill as many people as she can so they won't be alone in the house.

He says that he is an office clerk with a sedentary lifestyle and usually drives to his office. On 2 occasions last month he had to walk to his office, which is less than a quarter of a mile from his home. On both occasions, soon after walking, he experienced pain in the right thigh which subsided spontaneously within a few minutes. His past medical history is negative for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or ischemic heart disease. He is a non-smoker and non-alcoholic. His father has ischemic heart disease.
