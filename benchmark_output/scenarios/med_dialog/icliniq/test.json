      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

DVT or deep vein thrombosis is a condition where blood clot accumulates in lower limb veins due to prolonged bedridden state, reduced physical activity, after a major surgery or fracture of bones. These blood clots can often dislodge and go through the right heart to block the pulmonary artery. This condition is known as pulmonary embolism and can cause right ventricular cardiac dysfunction.

A mother with blood group negative and father with positive blood group can give a child with positive blood group and immunity develops in the mother's blood that can cause hemolysis in child's blood, in case of fetomaternal hemorrhage. In this scenario normally, anti-D has to be given to Rh-negative mother at 28 and 32 weeks in addition to a hemorrhage if she has or if the antibody titer is high on the blood test. It would be better if you would describe your complete obstetrics and gynaecology report, menstrual history and the medical history.

First of all, I want to tell you that beard growth is related to your hormones, mainly testosterone. Sometimes in some men, it took longer to grow a beard. You are still in your teen years. So do not worry and wait for some more years because as you will grow older, you will get more facial hair. The beard growth also depends on genetics too, so watch out your father and uncles too for their growth. Because some men get full facial hair in the late twenties. There is no food, supplement, or vitamin to increase the beard. So beware of these kinds of ads or supplements. Some people use testosterone gels or testosterone pills to increase their beard, but in the long run, these things have potential side effects. My suggestion to you is wait for some more years because you already have some facial hair and they will increase with time, so you do not have to worry. After some years, if you do not get as many hairs as you want, then you can opt-out for facial hair transplant. But do not do it so early because you are too young and you will get your beard to grow naturally after some years. I hope this helps. Failure of gonads or testes in men.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

The child will need nebulization with 2ml Duolin (Levosalbutamol sulphate and Ipratropium bromide) plus 2 ml normal saline.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I would like to know to weather the laser treatment is better than continuing specs for vision. What would be the drawbacks of laser treatment, is it very complicated? Doctor: Hello. This is quite a common question youngsters ask. The best answer to this is it depends on you and your daily activities, profession, and lifestyle, etc. For example, if you want to take up professional sports, modeling, enjoy adventure sports, few jobs in the armed forces, getting a surgery done would be quite necessary.  On the other hand, if you want to pursue higher studies and professions where you work a lot with computers and work on fine parts like watchmaking, then surgery would put you at a slight disadvantage as it slightly reduces image quality and increases chances of getting dry eye diseases. Some surgeons also prefer wearing glasses as it protects against infection and blood spurts during operations.  With the latest equipment and techniques, laser refractive surgery is quite safe, and outcomes are good. The risk involved is very less. Although a power of - 5.0 is on the higher side, we can still expect good results given that your corneas are suitable for the surgery.  The main thing to consider is of course long term outcomes are, 1. As a woman, your power will naturally change during pregnancy and lactation, and this happens to all women. Some have more, others less. This is unpredictable. 2. Surgery only corrects you for distance vision. Another natural change in eyes is presbyopia. Here you need to wear reading glasses. So even if you were to get surgery now, you would only remain glasses free for up to around 40 years of age after which you need reading glasses. I hope this answers your doubts. In case you have any further questions please let me know."

Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem.

The jawline and my teeth are still not aligned straight. I could not get the beautiful smile which I always admired. I do not want to go through the pain of braces again. Is there anything else I can do? And how long the procedure will be? Doctor: Hi. By looking at your pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it seems that your orthodontic treatment was not successful. Now it seems that you have more problems in your lower jaw. So, it is better to correct lower teeth only. You should either try to put crowns (cap) over the lower central four teeth, or there is a method called veneering where we put a half cap over the front teeth on both upper and lower to give a good look to your smile. Ask a specialist that is an endodontist to give veneers to the front six teeth on both upper and lower jaw. The procedure veneering is a little bit costly but gives a very good aesthetic smile makeover. Your weight is also very low which means your overall bone growth is not up to the mark."

But I am severely suffering from the same kind of cramps and pains for almost six years. Now when I went to the hospital, they said everything is normal. But the thing is I did not know that masturbation or any sexual feelings may cause it and I have never discussed about my sex life to doctors. Usually, I masturbate five to six times in a week continuously (not every week of the month). During this time I noticed whenever I do masturbation I get pains and cramps immediately after ejaculation. There are few days when I masturbate I get some relief to those pains and cramps. This is because I think I am not holding my breath while I masturbate. The problem now is my pain and cramps is still for six years. Please help me to come out of this painful life. Doctor: Hello.

Urinary tract infection may be a reason. Do you have burning or increased urination? 3. Epididymitis causing scrotal pain. 4. Diabetic neuropathy can cause such pain.

I would like to know the cause of this particular problem, and how it would\u00a0affect my child's health. Does she have to follow a particular diet or exercise? Will she be able to conceive? How long will she have to continue the treatment? Doctor: Hello. Initial periods around puberty can be irregular. If the diagnosis of PCOS (polycystic ovaries syndrome) is correct, she may require medicines to make her periods regular. PCOS girls are at a risk of obesity, diabetes, hypertension and endometrial hyperplasia. Many of those can be prevented by a good diet, regular exercise, preventing weight gain and taking progesterone tablets to induce a period, if they are irregular even after the age of 20. Regarding diet, there is no specific suggestion, but the consumption of fats and refined sugar should be cut down, and fiber intake increased. The calorie intake should be proportional to the calorie expenditure. In general, if she is following the diet and not gaining weight, it would suffice. Regular sweat-inducing exercise for at least 45 minutes is a must to avoid all the mentioned complications. Exercise is necessary even when she is not overweight. Regarding pregnancy, there is no need to worry, she can conceive easily with medications, if her periods remain irregular despite following the diet restrictions and exercise. There is no need to worry about it right now. Following a healthy lifestyle for the entire life is a must.

Masturbation and real sex are totally opposite things and the maximum portion is psychological rather than physical. In case of masturbation, we do hurry to ejaculate. But during intercourse, we try to make it late as much as possible. So psychology is totally different. During masturbation, you give your total concentration in doing that. You want to make your penis erect. So it occurs. You told that your penis is being hard enough and you are satisfied with that. So there is little chance of having a physical or hormonal problem.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Doctor: Hi. I can understand your concern regarding the dental health. Bleeding gums after removal of braces is a very common problem among all. So first of all, consult your dentist for scaling to remove local inflammatory factors.

Doctor: Hi. It can be an infection, but one thing you must remember is contact lenses should ideally be used 8 to 10 hours a day. If you wear during sleep and for more than 10 hours a day, there is a possibility of the eyes developing infection and transparency of cornea getting decreased over a long time.  You must stop wearing contact lenses till your eyes are clear. Start wearing spectacles. Contact lenses related bacterial conjunctivitis or  corneal hypoxia. Detailed slit lamp examination.

Tinnitus is the first sign of pathology of the ear connected with our nervous system. It is mostly seen as a subjective symptom in old age people which is due to slow degeneration of neuronal pulse.

Please suggest me some creams, so that it should not show any side effects. Also, how long I should use it? If I use anything, then will it have any effect in case of pregnancy, etc? Please help me. Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/dermatologist"

We are having trouble getting pregnant due to my absence of a menstrual cycle. When I was younger I did not get my period when I was supposed to and had to be put on birth control pills in order to get my first period. Since then I have been on and off on birth control pills and said Depo-Provera shot. I stopped getting my Depo shot four years back and I have not been on any method of birth control since. I only had my period twice after discontinuing the shot. The last time I had my period was four years back and then I spotted the whole entire first week of the very next month. Since then I have not had any type of spotting or bleeding. Of course, I need to be having a menstrual cycle in order to conceive but I am just in desperate need and I feel so hopeless because I feel like I am not be able to have any kids or if I do it will be in a long time. What can I do to get my period?  Should the Depo-Provera be completely flushed out of my body by now? I just want to have my period already and at least a normal cycle so I can finally have a baby. Doctor: Hi. Definitely you need a regular cycle to conceive. A regular cycle signifies a normal ovulation and thus a fertile status. I presume you are suffering from anovulation, which means absence of ovulation. There are 100 causes of anovulation whereas the most common cause of anovulation is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a complex endocrine disorder of uncertain etiology, where ovaries turn into cystic structures. Other causes are obesity, thyroid disorders, underweight, anorexia nervosa, stress, overt exercise, and usage of some medications. You have a body weight only 40 kg with BMI 17.28 (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This is a bit lower than normal weight.You were on antidepressant, which you have left, also which could cause anovulation. Are you suffering from any psychiatric illness still now? These all could cause anovulation and amenorrhoea. You have taken also Depo shot one year back. I do not know why you had taken, but this medicine itself can cause absence of cycle. Whatever may be the reason, you need a detailed evaluation. You need to increase your body weight, need hormonal screening (LH, FSH, thyroid, prolactin, testosterone) and an USG screening for polycystic ovaries. Just get a regular cycle and then try to conceive when you will achieve this. Anovulation. 1. Serum level of LH, FSH, prolactin, thyroid, testosterone. 2. USG lower abdomen."

Continue Kalarchi choornam until cycle is normalized that is three to four cycles and then stop it. Curd, curd rice, tender coconut water and lemon juice are to be consumed on these days. Strictly, no other diet. This will improve ovum growth and cause ovulation on day 14. Sexual contact should happen from day 11 to day 15. You can do scan to confirm the ovulation. You can get vishnukranthi herbal from herbal shop. From day 1 to day14, boil this herb 10 g in 200 mL water till it reduces to 100 mL. This should be taken in morning empty stomach.

Doctor ordered for the bloodwork and everything was normal except a slightly elevated sedimentation rate of 36 and a CRP is 8.5.

He had a fever and sore throat for about a week before and conjunctivitis for about four days before getting his blood work done. The plan is to test him again after a month. I wanted a second opinion as I am worried about the elevated sedimentation rate and CRP. Do you believe it could be easily explained due to being sick a little before the blood work? He also has eczema, could that be the cause for these elevated levels as they are related to inflammation? Are those levels concerning something like cancer? I would love to some reassurance. Doctor: Hello. Elevated sedimentation rate of 36 and a CRP of 8.5, looks nonconcerning to me. Not sure, what made you think about cancer. Usually, small kids do catch unknown bugs from their peer groups without throwing many symptoms. It seems he had a recent viral infection which can explain these lab reports. Nowadays we even do not check often these numbers. I am sure your doctor would have checked the kid for any lymph nodes in the neck and axilla. A follow-up lab check after month can be done. Meanwhile, if he is eating, playing well, I am not concerned. Cancer will present with more aggressive symptoms of fever, night sweats, lumps in the body. Usually, kids are more sicker than you are saying in your case. But it is always good to keep a watch for these symptoms. Viral infection, unknown. None. Observation and follow up."

A headache is quite common and it will need a long time to recover (weeks). Painkillers and Mannitol perfusions will help against the pain. The most concerning thing is the blood thinner which should be adjusted properly, considering the high INR levels, indicating an overdose.

Doctor: Hi. Stones smaller than 6 mm are likely to pass without any intervention. Those that are larger than 6 mm or which cause severe pain, vomiting, or fever need surgical removal (endoscopic). In your case, the stone should pass in a few days time. If pain recurs, you can go for admission and flush therapy (intravenous fluids to flush out stone) for one or two days. You can stop either Aceclofenac or Mefenamic acid as both are pain killers. Take either of the two. Also, add Capsule Urimax 0.4 mg (Tamsulosin and Dutasteride) once daily for five days, this may relax your ureter and help decrease the pain.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill.

Doctor: Hello. The current biopsy results are indicative of a lichenoid type of lesion in the buccal mucosa. This type of picture can be seen due to a variety of causes ranging from allergens to systemic drugs, anything causing irritation (like dentures), etc. Though the presence of rash, uveitis and recurrent mouth ulcers would be suspicious of Behcet's disease, the biopsy results are not what would be typically seen in Behcet's disease.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I am afraid of side effects and full urine retention. This is my last medical report showing on palpation, the prostate was not suspicious. The prostate was soft and not sore. On ultrasound, the upper urinary tract was normal, the renal outflow down to the bladder on both sides free. No sign of stones or tumor in the area of the kidneys or urethra.On transrectal ultrasound, the prostate was found with minor calcifications as remainings of former inflammatory processes. Otherwise, the tissue was homogeneous. The prostate volume about 28 cc. The transrectal longitudinal section of the prostate showed a suspicion of anarrow bladder outlet. There also just in the outlet the calcification was seen. Residual urine was about 120 cc. The bladder wall showed a hypertrophy of the muscular fibers.On urethrocystoscopy, a normal exterior urethra was found. The passage to the prostatic urethra showed in the bladder outlet some inflammation processes of the mucosa. The mucosa started to bleed even on soft touching. The bladder outlet was stiff and narrowed. The bladder itself showed some hypertrophic muscle fibers. Otherwise, the bladder was uneventful. Doctor: Hi. I have gone through your query and would like to know a few more details about your symptoms. 1. Is your predominant complaint that of increased frequency or weak urinary stream? 2. Do you have any discomfort in the region between your scrotum and anal opening? From your doctor's report, his findings on examination, scans, and cystoscopy, it appears that you have sequelae of prostatitis where the prostate gland becomes fibrotic and hard not relaxing to allow normal urine flow. It is common that in patients with obstructed flow especially due to prostate inflammation, the symptoms of urgency and frequency usually resolve. However, in your case, since you have had the symptoms for more than two years, I would like to do a urodynamic study to identify the overactive bladder and also if there is a definite obstruction. As you are already on Silodosin, I do not think that adding Lioresal (Baclofen) will help in the improvement of your symptoms significantly. If Silodosin does not give you any relief, based on the cystoscopy findings, I would rather recommend surgery after a urodynamic examination."

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I did not have sex in the past 12 months, but prior to that I had sex with multiple partners and once without condom too. Please help me. Doctor: Hello. This is molluscum contagiosum, which is a viral disease and spread by contact (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Contact can be sexual or nonsexual. But, in your case it is sexual as the molluscum is present in the genital area. It is STD (sexually transmitted disease). So, we have to check other diseases also like HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and hep B (hepatitis B virus) test. Do not touch it as it will spread by touching. Otherwise, it may infect to other parts too. Treatment is very simple. You have to go to a local dermatologist and he will give local anesthesia by injection or by applying cream, which ever suits you. After making that area numb, doctor would puncture the entire lesion one by one and remove the whitish material completely. This whitish material contains virus, so once it removed everything would be healed and you will be cured. I suggest that you must check out HIV and hep B test for further evaluation.

Could my TMT be false positive? Should I repeat it? Please help. Doctor: Hi. I welcome you and want to assure you do not worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. I feel sorry for the issues you have with your health. But, do not get panic as there is a solution to every health issue you have. I will come to your queries one by one in the order you asked.  1. Yes, you need an angiography immediately as per your medical record suggests (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Please do not get worried about angiography as you will feel only one single prick of the injection of a normal gauge needle which you already have been taken many times in life. The rest of the procedure is painless. You will be conscious, no general anesthesia needed. You will be listening to the doctors and watching your heart's blood vessels on the screen too. So, it will rather be a pleasant procedure.  2. Risks are associated with everything in life, so are with angio. There are no major risks in most cases. But, some minor chances are there for heart attack, injury to the artery of manipulation, irregular heartbeats, stroke, torn artery or a chamber of heart, an allergic reaction to the dye used for angiogram, radiation exposure is also a risk from x-rays used, kidney problems, bleeding and post angiography infection.  3. Postponing the angiography may have no serious problem or may lead to sudden cardiac event that may be fatal and may have serious life-threatening consequences such as heart attack and death before reaching the hospital. I advise you to go for angio and do not postpone it.  4. The change in ECG (electrocardiogram) sometime happens with variation of results but rarely happens to complete cure with medication. Especially, you got LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy) although to a lesser extent now, that may come back and further deteriorate if not dealt with in a timely manner.  5. Constriction in neck and breathlessness or shortness of breath is the major sign of the partial blockage in vessels of heart and that is over there; you or your reports deny it or accept it. You have issues with sleeping too. That is also a major sign of coronary artery disease and the LVH. It may lead to congestive heart failure in near future if not treated timely.  6. When your body needs more oxygen in the time of increased demand due to some activity or emotional imbalance, it leads to the increased heart beats and forceful pumping so as to fulfill the demand. This increased workload on heart muscles demand more blood and oxygen to the heart muscles too. But, there is partial obstruction and heart's own blood supply is not met with leading to decreased cardiac output in that specific time of body's increased need and the symptoms appear like neck and throat constriction and shortness of breath.  7. You have chest pain that is unrelated to exertion. This is more dangerous and serious. Pain on exertion means less coronary artery lumen obstruction. Pain at walking or at rest means there is more obstruction. There is no need to repeat your exercise stress testing. Angiography. If found positive you may need angioplasty then and there in the same procedure. That will be good as in a single procedure all will be handled.

(right now I am quite worried and would like to avoid MRI) I have been feeling like this for past six months but the stiffness is getting less often now, so it is improving. But I still feel it when moving my left hand and sometimes when I am standing, and it gets worse towards the end of the day. I do around three sessions for 20 minutes of cross-trainer every day. It does not affect me when I am doing it, but could it be responsible for my stiffness? Otherwise, I feel extremely healthy, though during the last period I felt a little tired mentally with all the overthinking related to this injury, cause I am used to being perfectly healthy. Doctor: Hi. I have reviewed your question. After reading your post, I immediately thought you might have a rib subluxation. This is very common with scoliosis (I myself have frequent rib issues). Since you know you have scoliosis, this will explain why this issue appears to be chronic. To specifically answer your questions, here are my answers. If you were my patient, I would perform a chiropractic examination and would most likely recommend chiropractic adjustments and exercises if you were a candidate for care. Since you are not my patient, I recommend that you continue to go to a local chiropractor for treatment and proper care.

      "tgt": "My blood test result shows high FT4, high insulin and low vitamin D. What could be the cause?",
      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor,  I would like some help with my blood test results as my doctor has not been able to help. I have a multinodular goiter with six nodules, the largest is 5 cm x 2 cm. I am particularly concerned about the high FT4 (while FT3 is below optimal level), high PTH, low vitamin D, high CRP and ESR, high insulin, and high IgA. Do you have any suggestions on what could cause these results? My symptoms include chronic diarrhea, occasional constipation, abdominal pain, fluid retention, extremely irregular periods, fatigue with trouble sleeping, frequent headaches, occasional dizziness, bone, joint pains, and weight gain. Most of these only showed up in the last few months after goiter was found. My saliva cortisol results are also on the very low end of range. I have attached my blood test results. I am currently taking Tramadol. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query and the results that you have attached. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  It does not seem you have any thyroid disease as of now since your TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is normal and your T3 and T4 are at acceptable levels and nothing to worry about that. Some people do have thyroid nodules which should be assessed yearly by ultrasound to make sure they are not increasing in size or texture. My advice for this aspect would be repeat thyroid function tests yearly and do an FNAC i.e an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the thyroid nodule to be sure it is benign. Yes, you do have vitamin D deficiency and when you have this, you automatically have high parathyroid hormone levels that is called secondary hyperparathyroidism and that occurs usually with vitamin D deficiency and gets better when that is treated. My advice is to have sun exposure 30 minutes daily and take vitamin D and calcium supplements. I do not know what type of hyperparathyroidism your niece is having but I assure you that yours is not to be worried about. Your saliva cortisol I do not think we usually worry about salivary cortisol levels. Try doing a serum cortisol levels if you are worried to be sure in the morning particularly. I know your serum CRP (c-reactive protein) and immunoglobulins are high but they are signs of allergy or immune reaction to any food. They could also be the cause behind your bone and joint pains including vitamin D deficiency. What I am concerned about is your high insulin levels as they suggest that you have insulin resistance. That could be due to polycystic ovaries or sedentary lifestyle or impending diabetes or metabolic syndrome. My advice would be to have a pelvic ultrasound since you also have irregular periods and you might benefit from a consultation with the gynecologist. In the meantime try to exercise 45-60 minutes daily and sleep for eight hours and consume low carbohydrate, low-fat diet, and avoid sweet drinks absolutely. Take the help of a nutritionist to lose weight. You might benefit from tablet Metformin 500 mg thrice a day. It will help you with your PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) and the metabolic syndrome as well and help with the high insulin levels and also cause slight weight reduction. I hope this helps. Tablet Metformin 500 mg thrice a day. Lifestyle modification."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I am having stomach pain just below where the upper and lower ribs meet at the center in the upper belly. I had Avil (anti-allergy) 0.25 mg tablet. What else can I do? Doctor: Hello. I can understand you are worried about your health. I know you got digestive system problems based on the possible food poisoning after you ate what looks like a contaminated food from a local food chain. It is a widespread issue, and many people whole eat from outside get food poisoning if the food was contaminated. You are taking the very best step of hydrating yourself. I would advise taking plenty of fluids (as you are already taking) plus ORS (oral rehydration solution) or Pedialyte to rehydrate yourself. Keep an eye on the symptoms, and if they are severe enough, you should rush to a healthcare provider or a hospital. The time you need to seek medical attention would include any one or many of the following five severe symptoms, 1. High fevers (over 102 degrees of Fahrenheit, when measured with an oral thermometer). 2. Blood starts coming in stools. 3. You take fluids, and they cannot go down the stomach due to severe and frequent vomiting. No liquid is staying inside the gastrointestinal tract, and you may get dehydrated in that way. 4. Symptoms of dehydration that you can feel by yourself, e.g., dizziness on standing up, decreased urine volume and dark colored urine, very dry mouth and throat, and no sweating. 5. Diarrhea lasting more than 72 hours from the time of its onset after the food poisoning. You got this stomach cramps (pain) in a timeframe of 30 minutes to an hour after eating the food. This refers to the possibility of food poisoning caused by a germ named Staphylococcus aureus (commonly abbreviated as staph). And this type of bacteria affects the foods not cooked adequately after handling. These foods can include but not limited to sliced meats, puddings, sandwiches, pastries. I hope it helps.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

This is defined as the persistent or intermittent sensation of a lump or foreign body in the throat for at least 12 weeks. The most common causes would be gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), abnormalities of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), psychologic and psychiatric disorders, and stress. I would suggest an evaluation with an upper endoscopy as a more comprehensive evaluation for anatomic abnormalities. A 24-hr pH study can also be considered to definitively rule in or out GERD. If the GI workup is not revealing, you may want to be evaluated by an ENT specialist to see if there are any upper esophageal sphincter disorders. Reflux is treatable by starting antacids, taking smaller meals, avoiding spicy, oily and junk foods, avoiding late night meals, avoid stress and anxiety, raising the head of your pillow by 6 to 8 inches."

It was concerning but not painful until a few days later, it gave me extreme shooting, throbbing pain. This lasted for a about a week then started to fade to what it is today, a numb pain that gets sharp if I support my weight too much on that foot. This has limited my movement quite a bit, which makes it hard to complete my daily tasks, and I cannot wear closed toe shoes anymore without pain.

This has all happened in the course of a month. Does this condition sound familiar and if so, what should I do to get treatment for it? Doctor: Hello. Your problem looks like varicose vein. Veins will bulge when you are standing or moving around when unlike down it regressed and blood flows back into the deeper veins and empty back into the heart. Varicosity is due to incompetence or weakness in the valves within veins which prevents the blood from flowing back as the blood has to be returned to the heart for recirculation. Due to weaknesss in the calf muscle which contracts and compress the deeper veins causing blood to be squeezed out of then for upward emptying into the vena cava and into the heart. Blockage of the pathways of flow or deep veins due to venous thrombosis, usually common in women, tends to increase with age, and with use of contraceptive pills and with pregnancy because of increased intraabdominal pressure which in turn comprises the vena cava and affect return of blood back to the heart. Complications can be venous thrombosis due to increased stasis of blood. If there is so much build up of pressure for long time can cause venous ulcers. Management is elevation of the leg when lying down. Use compression stockings to support and collapse the veins, avoid use of high heels. Change your standing or sitting position from time to time. You can do Doppler ultrasound scan."

Kindly advise the precautions and any diagnostics. Longtime back, I was diagnosed for spondylitis but there is no pain usually. Doctor: Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  Since you are a diabetic and hypertensive, in such a case I would like to evaluate you for the possibility of transient ischemic stroke (TIA). I would recommend an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) brain and a color Doppler. If all results are normal, then this could be a postural fainting attack, cervical myalgia or could be simply stress-induced. So, go ahead with the tests. Start exercises, meditation for stress relief. Never skip your breakfast. Do not stand for long hours. Drink plenty of fluids. Also, keep a watch on your blood pressure. I hope this helps."

We both have been checked and confirmed with no issues with HSG (tube test, semen analysis, etc.). As we want to have a baby, and all the reports are normal, (only problem is ED, not able to perform intercourse), the doctor has suggested self-insemination at home. He has given a catheter, a container for collecting sperm and syringes to perform the self insemination. He suggested to add equivalent amount of ringer lactate solution with the sperm collected in the container. Then, take the mixture in a syringe and flow into the vagina through a catheter. We just want to have a second opinion to know whether it works out and mainly want to know why we need to add ringer lactate solution along with the sperm. What is the importance of adding ringer lactate? Is it mandatory to add this solution or can we do without the solution? Your inputs will help us to know the process in a better way. Doctor: Hello. Ringer lactate is not mandatory. Sometimes, it helps with the sperm speed, but you can do without it. Your erection problem may be due to stress or anxiety or due to any medicine or nutritional supplement if you are taking any. Penile Doppler often gives erroneous results. Usually, it is not performed properly with visual erotica. You need to do blood tests: Depending on the reports, the treatment is decided.

He is not interested in any food including chocolates. Please give me the proper solution. Doctor: Hello. Firstly, rickets is completely reversible and nothing permanent. Your babies values are very mildly affected. So, by the course you are giving him it will be cured completely. Your pregnancy chicken pox has nothing to do with his condition presently. So do not feel guilty in any way. Coming to food issue, it is perfectly alright for your child to eat semi-solid food. Do not worry about that. Some children like the texture of the food being semisolid. Please encourage him to drink more milk and eat a lot of curd. Please do not force the kid as it can lead to repulsion.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling.

He suggested the use of Modafinil. While doing some research, all the side effects did not bother me, except for SJS syndrome. My psychiatrist did not have experience with this side effect while dealing with other patients. I am a bit anxious about it, so I decided to have someone else to give me advice about it. What do you think and is there a way to predict or avoid SJS? Doctor: Hello. You may know that Modafinil is a psychostimulant drug which can be used to promote wakefulness. It is known to cause cutaneous side effects in some people. SJS (Steven-Johnson syndrome) is a very rare side effect, and it is difficult to predict unless there are any known risk factors. Is there any particular reason you are more worried about SJS? Did you develop any cutaneous side effects with other drugs? Did anyone in the family develop SJS? Is there any history of immunological problems? In these circumstances, there is an increased risk of SJS. Otherwise, it is difficult to predict such a rare occurrence. Many commonly used drugs like Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) have also been implicated in SJS. So if you notice any fever, skin rash, and blisters after taking the medication, the stop it immediately and seek medical help. If you are feeling anxious about this rare side effect, then another option will be not to take Modafinil. You can try healthy caffeinated drinks which are also effective stimulants and help during course work. I hope this helps."

I was put on Augmentin and then Clindamycin, along with the use of Motrin and Tylenol as directed by my dentist. Since then, I have had stomach issues including: going to the bathroom more often, feeling pressure when having to go to the bathroom, occasional mucus in stool, and more recently, bouts of nausea, bloating/cramping, and very smelly gas. I have had various blood panels, tried probiotics (including VSL), rifaximin, diet changes, and I'm currently on Viberzi, which helped but made me a bit constipated/tired/bloated, so I lowered the dosage to 1 pill (100mg) per day instead of 2, which decreased side effects but also decreased effectiveness of the drug. Also, it seems my metabolism has shifted after the antibiotics and I gained weight faster than I ever have, and I am still struggling to keep my weight down after making significant diet and lifestyle changes. Any insight here into the weight gain and then anything else I could try for the stomach symptoms? Thank you! Doctor: Hello, Welcome to icliniq I have reviewed your concern. After taking antibiotics your gut bacterial composition has been changed and it has started to cause troubles for you. Weight gain is also seen in such cases. Since you have tried a lot of things and finally viberzi showing some results for you. I am happy things have finally got some control. For your concern regarding relatively rapid weight gain and metabolic shift is genuine. I would say, you are a good observant. What further helps you to restore your gut bacterial composition is to opt for natural selection. Like food changes, you have to avoid junk and bakery products as much as possible, Take alot of yoghurt (natural probiotic) and fruits. Increase use of vegetables. Avoid alcohol if you are taking. Continue exercise or at lease try to remain active. Collectively, this will change the story, you will feel better, but definitely process is slow and it will take time. So you have to exercise patience. I hope you will find it super helpful, give your feedback, let us know after a week, how you feel.

It would be better if you could start continuous brushing after every meals. Use dental floss to remove food stuck between teeth.

This can be replenished by eating food rich in Vitamin A like carrots, red peppers, spinach, mango, muskmelon, watermelon, papaya, and guava. If you are a non-vegetarian, eggs, lamb liver, salmon and tuna are good sources.  Stress and lack of sleep can also lead to dark circles. So try meditation and regulate the sleep cycle.

I am attaching a picture of this fleshy growth. Please help. Doctor: Hi. I have seen your attached picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It shows old hemorrhoids called as skin tags. This picture, along with the pain that you are describing is suggestive of anal fissure. This is a tear in the wall of the anus, at the base of these skin tags. Here is what you need to do: To heal the fissure, do sitz bath. Take lukewarm water in a medium sized tub, put two teaspoons of ordinary salt per liter of water. Total 10 g salt per liter of water. Now sit in this water and try to push out on the anus. Try to make the water clean and sooth your anal region. Sit for around 15 minutes, 3 to 4 times every day for a month or so. Try to do this at least twice per day if you are working professional. It will decrease pain, itching, and help to heal the fissure. Do these for around 6 to 8 weeks. For pain relief during passing stools as well as healing of the fissure, I suggest the following or equivalent generic combinations for at least three weeks, after that only sitz bath should be enough: For constipation, I suggest you try the following: Curing constipation treats these and also prevents these from troubling again.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, How conclusive are three months negative HIV fourth generation duo test? I did an unprotected vaginal and oral sex with a prostitute and have feet and leg burning pain, prickling, tingling in feet and hand fingers. Is there any test that tells I am 100% HIV free? My doctor told me it can take up to five years to detect HIV but on the internet it says three months. Please clear my doubt. When can I do the final test and what I do for my symptoms? Is there any other test for that? Is this neuropathy of HIV? Doctor: Hello. Generally, the HIV infection takes few days to years to produce the symptoms (it is called as incubation period). The incubation period is not fixed in HIV infection. It is the time taken for the organism to establish itself within the human body. As all of us know that HIV establishes when one's immunity comes down. So, if someone's immunity is good enough, he may not develop any symptoms even after HIV infection. If the immunity had come down, then the HIV infections will be expressed. Thus, the clinical symptoms appear based on patients immunity. Similarly, the few tests show positive only after the immunity has come down. But, there are some confirmation tests that tell about HIV even in the early stages. The fourth generation HIV test is one among such tests. Thus, we can come to the conclusion that you are HIV negative. The peripheral neuropathy may be due to other causes. Definitely, it is not due to HIV. The first symptoms of HIV infections are continuous fever, body weight loss and chronic diarrhea. In advanced cases, there will be white coating in tongue, continuous sputum expulsion by cough and peripheral neuropathy. I feel you no need to repeat the HIV test again. If you still want, do it after one year. Be prepare your mind that HIV is negative for you. It is the confirmation test."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am a 28 year old female, and today I went for an ultrasound scan of the abdomen, as advised by my family physician. My test report shows small hypoechoic lesion of 7 mm in the fundus\u00a0myometrium. It is indicative of a fibroid, and my endometrial thickness is 7 mm.\u00a0What is the meaning of this 7 mm lesion? How will it impact my health? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? If I may suggest, just forget the report, let me explain why. Fibroids or myomas are harmless masses in the uterus, which are hormone dependent. It keeps growing as long as you have estrogen, so once your hormones stop after menopause, it will cease to grow and may regress. They never turn malignant. If you scan 100 ladies randomly, 50 to 70 % ladies will have fibroids of varying size. But they should never be treated unless they are causing some symptoms like excessive or intermittent bleeding during periods, excessive vaginal discharge, severe pain in the lower abdomen during periods, pressure symptoms on the bladder or bowel or back or kidney, or if the fibroid is interfering with the baby. We advise any fibroid of more than 5 cm should be removed, it grows at 1 to 2 mm per year, so you should have no problem. So just forget it, maybe have a scan again after 2 to 3 years or when trying for pregnancy. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

These are difficult to explain here but you can find them online and can practice. These are Medicines for premature ejaculation are SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). SSRI as a class has side effects of delayed ejaculation so this side effect is used here as a therapeutic one. I suggest you can either try Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, or Sertraline once a day.  Also, Dapoxetine can be used on an as and when required basis at least one hour before the sexual activity. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the above medicines. First, try behavioral methods and continue using them as these techniques take time to show their effect. Similarly, the drugs also take one to two weeks to show their effect. These drugs are prescription drugs. Thanks and regards. For more information consult a sexologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/sexologist"

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Now a week later, I have been bleeding for two days. I hope this is not a sign of pregnancy. Please help me understand it better. Doctor: Hello. Ideally, the emergency contraceptive pill is to be taken within 72 hours of last intercourse to be effective 99 %. It is of no importance if taken after a week. Nevertheless, the bleeding which you got mid cycle before you took the pill was likely to be an ovulation bleed as you had sex in your safe period, then you took the high dose progesterone emergency pill, which initiated a progesterone withdrawal after two days in the form of bleeding as expected. This rules out pregnancy as you had a withdrawal bleed, but it is always best in such cases to get a serum beta hCG test done to be conclusively sure."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I need some relief from this problem. Can you suggest a good solution for this? Thank you. Doctor: Hello. I feel sorry for the symptoms you have. I am more than happy to assist in getting you out of this situation. Keep an eye on how to use the medications suggested to be used. Asthma is a disease that needs serial evaluation and World Health Organization recommends adjusting the dosages according to serial evaluation as every patient needs different regimens. 1. May be due to some allergens like fomites (an object contaminated with infectious organisms), animal dander, open fresh air, pollution on roads, dust allergy from carpets in home, dust from your bedding, colognes, etc.  2. Nasal or throat diseases also cause this issue in many patients. For example nasal polyps, nasal septal defects, etc. Respiratory function tests, one test right now and keep as a record before starting the medications. Other test few weeks later when you will be going to consult a physician about your condition. 1. Inhaler Albuterol sulfate (Proventil HFA or Ventolin HFA and ProAir HFA) use either of them as needed. If you feel short of breath and feel you are ongoing oxygen debt, take two puffs of this metered dose inhaler. Keep a record that how many times a week you need to use this inhaler. If you need to use it before or after an exercise of physical activity and then write that down separately that you needed to use it that many times with exercise related shortness of breath. 2. Tablet Prednisolone (Pediapred or Prelone and Orapred) to be taken 5 mg two times a day. 3. Tablet Montelukast 10 mg at evening once daily. 4. Take tablet Fexofenadine 60 mg at night once daily. 5. You need to start these medications right away. Get back after few weeks. We continuously have to keep an eye on the condition and treatment goes accordingly. In case you have fever, you may take tablet Acetaminophen.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Doctor: Hi. Your concern is genuine and you are so brave and facing all challenges very bravely. You did not mention your prolactin and thyroid hormone levels. Loss of hair can be autoimmune as you were treated for it as well and due to Hashimoto as well. If there is no skin issue involved in the loss of hair (you should consult a dermatologist for it) it may be due to your autoimmune disease. Hashimoto is autoimmune as well. What you can do is that you decrease the TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) target to a lower level with increasing Levothyroxine and then see if it has a better effect. I hope this helps."

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I had sex for the first time.\u00a0After that, I did not get my periods yet. I went to a gynecologist. She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods? Doctor: Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

After going through your query and image sent by you (attachment removed to protect patient identity), this seems to be a case of severe infection inside the right tooth. Tooth decay has resulted in infection in the innermost part of the tooth called pulp that contains nerves and blood vessels. Deep dental caries. Intraoral periapical radiograph (X- ray). Acute periapical abscess or buccal space infection. Acute exacerbation of chronic periapical abscess. 1. Treatment can be planned after analyzing the X-ray. 2. To reduce pain and swelling, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs can be given for 3 to 5 days. 3. If infection beneath the root is not in excess, then root canal treatment can be done. 4. In case of excessive pus and infection, pus drainage followed by extraction should be done. 5. Immediate extraction is not advisable. 1. No hot fomentation should be done. 2. The face should not be covered. 3. No massage should be done. 4. Biting from the affected side should be avoided."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it?

Also, I get random aches all over the body. Doctor: Hello.  I understand your concern. Pain on the left side of the abdomen, along with burping and stomach pain are all suggestive of colitis. Since your stool is also green in color, it is advisable that you get your stool examined for parasites and ova. The sensation in the neck seems to be unrelated to your colitis, however, it could be due to acid reflux. Ranitidine will help and you need to continue. For such colitis, I will advise Ofloxacin and Ornidazole twice daily for five days. Random aches are also suggestive of colitis and infection. So start the medicine and get your stool evaluated.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I was having it only in the morning. I didnt had any other symptoms except feeling tired. I took advil sinus and used seawater nasal spray. It lasted couple weeks. After I only had a bit mucus dripping my throat when I woke up, but generally felt well, until couple months after I started to hurt and feel pressure in my inner right eye. I went to walk in clinic and got prescribed Amoxicillin/Potassium Clav for 7 days. My eye got better, but after I stopped antibiotics, after couple days I started to feel unwell again, so I contacted another doctor online and he prescribed me another antibiotics Clarithromycin 500 mg for 10 days. After I finished them, again the same. One day past and I didnt felt well. I was feeling tired, pain in my nose, my ears, even dizzy, my body temperature was higher than regular 37.2. So I contacted a nurse online and she told me that probably antibiotics doesnt work, because I had viral infection and told me to avoid diary, take vitamin C, D and probiotics( I was taking them and with antibiotics). It past two weeks generally I feel better, but still have stuffy nose in the morning with a bit yellow mucus, hurt my nose, or feel pressure in it. But I started to worry, because I started to have headaches on top of my head sometimes going to the back part and sometimes tingling feeling in the left side of my head, also I feel my heart rate is higher, specially in the morning. I already thinking maybe I am having anxiety, when I read what can happen if you dont treat sinus infection.  I am using corticosteroid nasal spray, seawater spray, neti pot. Should I contact again doctor online and ask for more antibiotics? I guess with all this Coronavirus, I cant get referral to ENT specialist .Do you have any advice how I should treat it? Doctor: Hi, Looks like your having a chronic allergic problem out there. Now there are certain things which have to be understood in detail. 1. Allergic rhinitis is an immune complex issue which is innately present and starts showing symptoms at one particular age. It basically is a hyper responsiveness to something which is foreign and has accidentally entered into you nose causing cascade of chemical events leading to nasal congestion, watery nasal discharge, sneezing, itching in eye and nose, fullness in the ear and often leads to sinusitis causing heaviness in the area of your face involving the frontal and maxillary regions besides your nose. 2. Antibiotics has a limited role here unless it's an infection that we are are treating 3. You have to wear a n95 mask and not allow the triggering factor to enter into your nose in the first place (trigerring factors range from dust, pollens, animal fur, fumes, strong odours etc and the list is endless), allowing the triggering problem to keep entering your nose is just going to prolong the problem through life and no medication will ever be effective 4. Nasal steroid sprays have definelty a role to play, I usually suggest a combination of a topical steroid such as fluticasone propionate along with a antihistamine such as azelastine hydrochloride 2 puffs in each nostril 2 times a day 12 hrs apart for 3 months straight 5. Certain antiallergics containing fexofenadien 120mg one tab two times a day 12hrs apart for 20 days is effective. Antibiotics like clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day if taken have to used for 2 long months to be extremely effective(I give clarithromycin for both its antibiotic and immunomodulatory activity, later of which is more important) 6. Salt water gargles 8 to 10 times a day for 10 days, sipping on warm water, steam inhalations avoiding cold, spicy and oily junk food goes a long way, smoking and alcohol to be completely avoided as it slows down the mucociliary activity and leads to secretions inisde your nose causing a severe sinusitis and its related problems. Hope this advice helps"

I have seen the picture attached along with your complaint (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have severe dental fluorosis along with severe external stains. It is definitely possible to get whiter teeth with the help of dental veneers. Firstly the procedure includes complete thorough cleaning of the stains. Secondly the teeth visible in your smile zone will have to be prepared (ground slightly on the front surfaces) to fix in the dental veneers. Coming to the cost of the procedure,there are two types of veneers. One is composite veneers which has to be done in the clinic manually by the dentist. But this has short life and a major disadvantage of discoloration. Two, ceramic dental veneers which have to be made in the laboratory and then fixed on the prepared teeth. Ceramic ones are much suitable for you as it can long last and hide the brownish colour of your present teeth to a greater extent but this is expensive than composite ones. Ceramic veneers have different price ranges and it depends on your dentist and the laboratory. Discuss with the your dentist about it and choose your best suited range."

You are already on an effective combination of medication to manage your underlying diagnoses. As you may know, you are on an antipsychotic ( Abilify), anticonvulsants (which are also mood stabilizers- Divalproex and Lamotrigine) and an antidepressant (Zoloft). Have regular follow-ups with your doctor so that dosage can be reviewed as needed. Do not stop any medication without guidance. If you experience any side effects, discuss with your doctor. In addition to medication, it is essential to have therapy and psycho-social support to help in your continuing recovery. Have you had any psychological treatment like CBT? CBT can be helpful in anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia as well. Have regular contacts with your trusted family and friends. It is essential to have ongoing social get-togethers and avoid social isolation. If you are in education or at work, try to make appropriate changes to manage your workload. Learn to manage stressors in your life. Apart from therapy, follow self-help strategies which can help you get back on track gradually.

I advise you to visit a gum specialist immediately and go through the blood count check. You might also have to take antibiotics. Before I suggest medicines please let me know if you have got any drug allergies.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

As I absolutely hated the patching I was not compliant and I still have a lazy eye. My right eye is nearsighted and my left eye is farsighted. I have worn glasses full time. I do not remember the diopters for each eye. My right eye over the years has increased in nearsightedness and my left eye is getting weaker because my brain ignores it. My right eye is corrected to 20/20 and my left eye is corrected to 20/40. My eye doctor says that I am one-eyed and surgery would only be cosmetic. I have been doing some research and I have found that through different eye exercises and patching one can improve eyesight in adulthood. My biggest concern is that if I should engage in these exercises. When I cover my right eye the left one immediately goes to the center and when I look up it goes up and left. I am worried because I am both near and farsightedness and if both eyes are used, I will get double vision. I hate being only able to use one eye at a time and I want to strengthen my left eye. What would you recommend? Should I engage in these exercises or just accept the fact that I will be monocular for the rest of my life? I look forward to your reply. I thank you in advance.

Since your vitamin B12 levels are towards the lower range of normal and bordering on deficiency, you can take vitamin B12 supplements.

Please help us. Doctor: Hello. I understand your concern for your child. 1. Complete blood count. 2. Absolute eosinophil count. 3. Chest x-ray. 4. Mantoux test. I suggest tablet Zentel (Albendazole) only today before sleeping. Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.

I am a ballet dancer and have been putting my hair in buns ever since I was little. Two years ago, I started training a full time course which meant I needed to put my hair in a bun every day with hairspray, and a lot of times I got home too late to wash it out. Now I am taking more caution but I have lost a lot of hair and my hairline has receded a lot. Is there anything I can do to reverse or help it? Doctor: Hello. From your description, it seems like it is traction alopecia that occurs due to excessive pressure on hair roots due to hair bun, etc. First thing is to make sure to relieve pressure from your hair roots. Use Minoxidil spray BD over the frontal area. Take biotin supplements BD for atleast three months. Follow up at one month."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

It has been four weeks after the treatment and I do not have any abdominal pain. I had been seeing the doctor before. Can the absence of the abdominal pain mean that I have healed? And can my fiance get sick from the inflammation if we have sex without a condom? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? No pain or discharge or itching means the infection has subsided, but a point you have to understand is that you got this infection only after you had sex. So your fiance is the source of the infection. So he too should have the same course of antibiotics. Treatment is never complete without both partners being treated. So he will not get inflammation, he will infect you again and your old symptoms will reappear. So I would advise you to give him same medications and avoid sex till he finishes the medicines and two weeks further so that the infection heals. Let him masturbate 1 to 2 times before you have sex, so all the dead infections too will be thrown out."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am 22 years old and I have two children. No health issues. Around four months ago, I had sharp stabbing pains in my pelvic area, foul odor discharge, irregular bleeding, yellow or brown vaginal discharge. I am in my second year of being on the contraception implant Nexplanon. Due to my age, the local doctor could not help and said I needed to go to a sexual health clinic so I did. They said I had BV (bacterial vaginosis) and gave me antibiotics. I still have bad smelly discharge even four months later. But my main concern is I was going to the toilet and as I wiped I felt a lump in the middle of my vulva. I asked my husband to have a look he said it looks like a skin tag. It is connected via the side of my vulva skin and around that area is different shades of color and it slightly hangs. Doctor: Hi. Do you have any other medical health issue or have been on medications? It is better to have a complete check and treatment if any health issue you have. Regarding discharge, it should be checked in the laboratory by sending a high vaginal swab to check which organism is causing smell and irritation. So, for vaginal discharge, you should have a high vaginal swab and its report needs to be checked here or with a local gynecologist doctor or even you can discuss with infectious control to get specific treatment, if needed. After collection of the swab, have tablet Metronidazole 400 mg eight hourly and tablet Doxycycline 100 mg 12 hourly for 14 days. After swab result, it might be possible that you need specific treatment as well or need to investigate and treat your partner as well. For lump at the vulva, it would be better if you would send me a picture of the issue. If it is lump hanging or coming out or seems to move out at coughing, the pressure or at abdominal stress, then it could be prolapse like cystocele, at rectum rectocele or urethrocele might be due to tissue weakness or increased intraabdominal pressure or difficult delivery. The skin over it could be different due to local friction even could be inflamed and bleed as well. If just small skin tags are hanging, those could be warts that is the infection actually. Any local cyst or abscess could be likely related to Bartholin gland that also needs to be treated. It is better to have one local examination at the time of collection of swab by the gynecologist. The skin tags or skin scrapping could be sent if it is wart like thing to confirm causative organism. In case of lump that could be cystocele, rectocele or urethrocele, and needs to be graded as in some cases, it needs exercises, vaginal pessary or even more advancd surgery.  Have a strict hygiene. Wear soft comfortable undergarments. Use condoms to prevent transmission of sexually transmitted infection. Sitz bath can be tried. Avoid local cosmetics. Use a soft blade to clean hair."

When someone tries to snap me out of it, I lash out. I think about suicide a lot, and I have a history of self-harm, and I have started to drink alcohol to feel normal. What is wrong with me? Doctor: Hello. You are reporting mood problems, history of self-harm and suicidal ideation. When you say you are spacing out, you are possibly describing dissociation which can be a result of high-stress levels. You will benefit by talking to your doctor or a counsellor to clarify the nature and extent of your symptoms and factors which could have contributed to your problems. The symptoms you report can happen in different conditions in adolescents. The common theme is high-stress levels and difficulty coping with the situation. With appropriate support, you will gradually get better. Have you discussed these issues with your parents or a trusted family member? I will strongly advise to talk to a trusted elder so that you can access further help. You can also talk to your school teacher or pastoral support. Be open and honest about your feelings. If talking is difficult, you can write down your feelings in a paper and share it with them. You can access support by seeing a counsellor at school or be referred by your doctor. Avoid alcohol. It will make your symptoms worse and more difficult to manage. Try positive coping strategies like exercise, learning martial arts, etc. I will recommend sharing this query to your parents so that they can support you. It is important to remember that you are not alone. Talk to others. At any time if you feel like you are not able to cope and keep yourself safe, you should talk to a family member or trusted elders. Take care."

Try to go to sleep and get up at the same time every day, and wake at the same time. 2. Do not take coffee or tea after 6 PM. Milk can be taken. 3. Cover the windows and doors with curtains and avoid light. Avoid watching TV lying in bed and avoid mobile phones. 4. Do exercise. Walk for 45 minutes after dinner. Take a bath after that.

There is no blood in stool, maybe has a light green color but overall brown with a bearable stomach cramp on the right side. I am currently taking Iron and Vitamin B12 tablets. Doctor: Hello. Likely it is not related to anal sex because it is not a common complication of anal sex and also bacterias will not proliferate so fast to give you diarrhea in the next morning itself. It is likely related to food consumption in last few days. I guess you do not have a fever. You need to have medicines for this, like antibiotics tablet Norflox TZ (Norfloxacin) 400 mg two times a day for five days along with some antacid like tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg or Rabeprazole 20 mg once a day before breakfast for five days. You will also need some probiotics like capsule Vizylac or Sporulac sachet three times a day till diarrhea subsides. For immediate pain relief, you can have antispasmodic like tablet Dicyclomine 20 or Hyoscine 10 mg whenever needed up to three times a day. Have plenty of water and ORS (oral rehydration solution). Also, with each stool, you have additional 100 to 200 ml of ORS.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Insulin check-up indicates that there is a high chance of becoming a diabetic patient. My doctor suggested me Ashwagandha, and I have been taking it for a month (two capsules per day). Not much gain. So, I would like to take DHEA supplements for beard growth, is it fine? Doctor: Hello. I think it is very normal to have less hair on the face. Even if you have little hairs, it is normal. Do not worry about your DHEAS level. You should not be taking any hormonal treatment unless it is required and so you can consult an endocrinologist for it. If you have normal sexual functioning, you should not worry about it. If it bothers you too much, you can ask a hair transplant surgeon and get a nice beard transplant. Focus on a healthy diet and regular exercise."

For the past years, my brother has had a big crush on his manager. He would always talk about her when he would come home from work. He would talk about her constantly. Sometimes even saying that she also likes him and that he knows they are going to end up together. He had the biggest crush and still till this day talks about her. He lost his job a few months ago and started acting weird. His manager is a different race. So when he was home after he got fired, he would constantly be outside wanting to get tanner because he said thats the way she likes guys. To be tanned how his old manager's race is. He would sit outside every single day wanting to get sunburned. He did indeed. Then weeks went by and he told my mom that his mission of sitting down outside was over and that he will start going to walk instead. At this moment all he does is wake up and go walk anywhere and walk to different places for no reason. He constantly says that he is married already with his old manager and that he is moving to another city. He says the same thing every time. He leaves since the morning and walks everywhere and comes back till the night. He does not do drugs but has a past of doing drugs. He used to drink every weekend before he started doing all of this. He would drink coffe every day before work. And on weekends drink alot. I and my family are concerned about him. We do not know what is wrong with him. He does not do drugs. He drinks sometimes on weekends, not often anymore. He says he is married and that he makes a call to someone and they pay all his bills. He leaves every day and walks anywhere. He knows what he does, he is aware. But we do not understand why he thinks stuff that is not in fact true. He is living in a fantasy. Doctor: Hello. He has developed an attraction for his manager and there was no actual relationship and then he lost the job. Then he started developing the symptoms. He has developed firm belief that he is married to his manager. His behavior has changed suddenly, lost the job and he is running or going out for sunbath without any explainable cause. These are most likely occurring due to some psychotic disorder. This could be due to delusions resulted due to psychosis. This cannot be ignored. His urgent psychiatric consultation is advised. Drugs like Olanzapine, Risperidone, Quetiapine, etc., can be used to control his symptoms."

The various causes for enlarged spleen include infection like malaria, Gaucher disease like storage disorder, hemolytic anemia, leukemia, lymphoma, infections, liver disease, etc. The CBC and peripheral smear examination report do not suggest leukemia. Hemolytic anemia also can be excluded as bilirubin level is normal. Liver disease chance also very less as reports are normal related to that (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As you have persistent spleen enlargement, it is advisable to investigate with spleen biopsy or FNAC for histopathology examination. It will help in identifying the underlying specific cause if present. You can consult a surgeon for a detailed evaluation and examination.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

If you did not have any intercourse after getting periods, you would not be pregnant. Your periods can be delayed if you have taken an emergency contraceptive pill. Do serum TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) and serum prolactin blood test on an empty stomach tomorrow morning to see if you have any hormonal imbalance.  Do USG (ultrasound) pelvis by transvaginal scan to see if you have PCOD (polycystic ovarian syndrome). If you are not sure of pregnancy, do serum beta hCG blood test to rule out pregnancy.

Now I will say that my diet has been kind of crazy since moving to another state. I am not sure if I should be worried about what is going on. Doctor: Hi. I understand that the earlier severe abdominal pain might have been due to the rupture of an ovarian cyst, form which you have made a good recovery since. As you have already pointed out a change of location and with that, an erratic diet pattern, the focus should be on any infection involving the large bowel which might be causing your symptoms. It is important that you keep in mind the following. 1. Please have well cooked and hygienic foods at all times. 2. Drink plenty of water and fresh juices and visit washrooms regularly. 3. Never skip meals during the day and if time permits, have helpings of fruits and snacks in between larger meals. 4. Control your anxiety and stress levels.

The problem arises when there is an imbalance in partners mutual love, care, expectations, etc. And it is more hurtful for the partner who gives more, the one who takes things little bit granted does not get affected. In this situation, my advise to you would be a direct and clear communication on what are your expectations and what things are hurting you. Do not plead in front of your partner for his time, love and care. This will make you even more granted in his life. Try to make friends also.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

This occurs with or without some amount of acid reflux into the throat from within the food pipe. This condition is called Laryngopharyngeal Reflux Disease (LPRD) and this may present simply with a sore throat and without any other symptoms of gastritis.  I would, therefore, recommend antiseptic mouth gargles with Chlorhexidine or dilute Betadine, three times a day before and after meals along with a good proton pump inhibitor such as tablet Esomeprazole 40 mg once in the morning 15 minutes before meals for one week.

The pain in the groin is due to pelvic renal calculi, the pain of which radiates to the groin.

She has been complaining of headaches for the past five to six months, which has been constant with heaviness around her forehead and the area between the eyes and the nose. We got all the recommended tests done including a CT scan of her brain, which showed some age related cerebral atrophy and bilateral basal ganglia calcification. The doctors said that it may be a chronic tension headache, for which they gave her medicines for three months. Now, it is almost two and a half months but, there is no improvement in her condition. For the past few days, her headache has increased and it is mostly on the forehead, eyes, and nose area. At night, her nose is severely\u00a0blocked, and the heaviness of the head bothers her a lot. It is affecting her day to day life. And lastly, her condition deteriorated the day she had acidity,\u00a0indigestion, and nausea. The medicines which she has been taking are Escitalopram 10 mg, Clonazepam 0.5 mg once daily, Nortriptyline 10 mg, Gabapentin 400 mg, Domperidone, Naproxen sodium for pain, and Rablet L in the morning. Apart from these, she has been under medication for hypertension for the past 10 years. They are Cilnidipine, Telmisartan and Rosuvastatin 5 mg. All her blood tests including electrolyte test, CBC, thyroid, etc., has been normal.\u00a0Only her EEG had shown some changes in the theta waves after which the CT scan of her brain was done.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

However, I did not get any sneezing or cough to date. At present, there is no fever. But after then, my right nostril is consistently producing foul-smelling greenish color mucous, and it is so repulsive as if something rotting inside. I doubted it is sinusitis and took Augmed 625 for three days (six tablets completed). The feverish feeling, body aches, and weakness resolved. However, this smelly mucus discharge, which is nauseating me 24 hours, is not getting cured. I am taking steam vapor twice a day along with Otrivin drops to relieve the congestion. While my left nostril is often transparent and occasionally produces normal white phlegm but right nostril is the culprit here. I am also getting headaches on the right side as if deep inside the skull and right jaw above the molar teeth. I consulted an ENT. She changed my antibiotics to Florenza 325 (twice a day) and also gave Mucolite SR tabs. I have already completed three days of this new regimen. But nothing seems to improve. She examined and said I do not have any visible Nasal polyps. My query is, does this sound normal to you? Does this sinusitis take very long to cure in spite of antibiotics? If it does not seem to be improved in the next two days, what would you suggest as the next course of action? The smelly discharge is nauseating me. I did not notice any blood in the phlegm. I keep blowing out the mucus and more seems to keep forming inside and occasionally drips down to the back of the throat. My tonsils are fine. I have no cough or sore throat or heaviness in the lungs. I am looking forward to the best remedy to get rid of this smelly mucus. Doctor: Hello. You defaulted on the course and dosage of Augmentin 625. It was supposed to have been taken thrice daily for at least five days. With the regimen that you made, I doubt if any bacteria would have got killed, but you would have most probably resulted in a resistant strain of bacteria inside your nose. Complete the second course of antibiotics as told by the ENT. If there is no improvement, give the mucus for culture sensitivity and take the right antibiotic. Additionally, take some antihistaminic and montelukast combination. Avoid excess steam if you are in polluted areas. Do not smoke or drink. Drink plenty of warm fluids. Get back to us if you need it. You may need a radiological investigation."

Pain has decreased by around 30-40 percent since it started 10 days back and I am not taking any NSAIDS for last 2 days. I have got a few concerns. Do these changes occur at this age (43 years)? How bad are the degenerative changes? Any need of surgical intervention? How much time usually it takes for complete resolution of acute episode? Is it going to be a trouble in future as well? I mean repeat episodes or further complications. What should be the life style changes after resolution of acute episode (you know the nature of a pediatrician\u2019s job)? If at all surgery is required in future (further canal stenosis causing cord compression), how risky is the surgery and how are the results? Doctor: Hi. I have gone through your medical history and the attached reports in detail (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It does not seem to be a serious matter at present. Yes neuropathies are common at this age. Usually, it takes around 3 to 4 weeks for an acute episode to resolve depending on the symptoms. If proper care is taken (avoiding use of pillow, avoiding lifting heavy weights, neck exercises) usually symptoms do not recur. At present there is no need of surgery. You are doing pretty well and recovering fast. Use cervical soft collar and take analgesics for atleast 10 days. Get a repeat MRI after 3 months.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I am all out of options.\u00a0I need some advice on what to do and some sort of diagnosis or at least a point in the right direction. Doctor: Hi. Foul smell is formed by bacteria. So, it is seen in conditions where they are residing for a long time. Normally our nose and throat have commensals and they get washed away by our normal secretions of the nose and throat. Bad smell in nose is seen in conditions like, atrophic rhinitis and pharyngeal web or diverticulum. Atrophic rhinitis, in which it smells bad. After some time, the patient does not get bad smell and only the people around get it. It is a nasal disease and can be diagnosed by examining nose. Pharyngeal web or diverticulum is a condition in which a small pouch is formed from pharynx, away from normal tract. So, whatever you eat, a part of it does not go to the stomach below and escapes into the pouch. It stays there for some time and automatically comes back in pharynx and goes stomach. In this condition, due to retention of food bad smell is produced. For further information consult an ENT otolaryngologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/ENT-Otolaryngologist"

But practically speaking people with active genital lesions can have active lesions over the oral mucosa which can shed the virus, which can be transmitted to their partner.

I have observed the picture and also gone through the history of present and past illness (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I could observe that there is tendency for the lesions to assume a shape that is generally seen due to excoriation. This implies that the primary lesion or symptom induces the subject to scratch resulting in this picture. Vasculitis tends to be diffuse and involves various body areas and more so on the dependent parts like lower legs and feet. Most such patients tend to spontaneously recover over time. However, an attempt must be made to find out whether any local factor might be operative like an insect or bug bite, postural pressure on the area, any disorder that would cause itching like heat rash or an allergy to some agent that is off and on applied to this part of the body.The petechiae seem to have resulted from scratching. Careful observation leads one to the cause in good number of cases. For symptomatic relief, one can consider giving anti-allergic medications."

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

There are two possibilities in you, first is of a spinal cause like spondylosis or compression of nerves and other is costochondritis. Does this pain increases on neck movement, or any neck trauma, these may be the associated symptoms. You should get X-ray cervical spine AP or lateral view. You need to visit physiotherapist after X-ray and also orthopedician. Does this pain increase on pressure over the area, if yes then it suggests the possibility of costochondritis? You will need a Naproxen then."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I do not like to have a baby now and I want to terminate my pregnancy with the help of MTP kit. Please advise me how and when to take medicine for termination. Do I need to take any other medicine with MTP? Please tell me in detail. I do not like to go hospital for this. Is it safe to get it done at home? Doctor: Hello. Firstly, your decision of not reporting to the doctor itself is very wrong and trying to abort at home is further wrong as MTP can lead to a lot of bleeding complications which you cannot manage at home after taking the medicine as a dosed protocol. The MTP kit (medical termination of pregnancy) is available in the market as unwanted, but the instruction to take the medication is not accurate for requirement of dose depends on the period of gestation first. Hence, it is necessary that you should undergo an ultrasound pelvis to locate the pregnancy first whether it is intrauterine or ectopic. Once intrauterine confirmed, then the tablets can be taken in a scheduled manner under your local gynecologist supervision in a sequential manner with Mifepristone first and then Misoprostol. Sometimes, Misoprostol has to be continued till 2000 microgram maximum dosage in case of failed abortion with the initial dosage, which may lead to surgical abortion or D and C (dilatation and curettage). So, it is recommended that you should meet your gynecologist first and do not attempt any home abortion. It is not safe at all."

He is absolutely fine and active. Was the medication sufficient? If not please suggest for his speedy recovery. Is this because of lactose intolerance? Do I need to stop feeding him on packaged milk? Currently we are using Amul. Thanks in advance for your response. Doctor: Hi. I have read your question in detail and I know that you are very concerned about your child but do not worry. By what you quote it seems that your child has probably got lactose intolerance, resistant stomach infection or worm infestation. I think you should do stool routine microscopy test and stool culture test to look for any infection and stool for reducing the sugar for lactose intolerance. It is seen in children that when they develop loose stools, sometimes the lactose intolerance may persist for 2 weeks. Continue Similac formula milk and stop Amul milk. Continue Darolac (Lactic Acid) for three days and Zinc syrup for a total of 14 days to increase gut immunity. No need to stop other foods or giving special items like tapioca water. Also, give deworming syrup like Bandy plus (Albendazole) 10 ml once at night before sleep."

I have slightly elevated blood pressure 138/78 and have been experiencing some ED symptoms the last six months or so. I have read that Viagra has been shown in a 20 year study to lower blood pressure while improving erectile dysfunction. What is your opinion on this? I have ordered a few 25 mg to try out. Doctor: Hello. Is your ejection fraction normal? Yes, Viagra (Sildenafil) can cause fall in BP as a side effect and you are also having Tamsulosin. So, it also predisposes one to BP fall. You need to use it cautiously. It is better to stop Tamsulosin if it is not absolutely necessary with Viagra. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and stop the medicine with their consent. And do not use other nitrates for the purpose of heart diseases like Nitroglycerin, Isosorbide dinitrate or Mononitrate, etc. Avoid dehydration and keep salt-sugar water or ORS ready if BP falls excessively.

Blood culture came back negative but she tested positive for RSV and also had bronchiolitis. She was discharged on the 15th and readmitted the next day 16th. The primary physician did not like the way she was breathing. My daughter was pinched several times in the ER for a blood culture which the next day came back positive. The doctor performed additional culture as he believes the positive results were due to a contaminate. Blood culture came back negative. The 42-hour culture that tested positive is appearing to be staph aureus. One doctor is suggesting getting a central line and treating her for 10 days. I am just looking for a second opinion as I do not see the logic in treating something they do not officially know she has. She has had no fevers. Doctor: Hello. I understand your concern. Culture positive for Staph Aureus infection needs treatment. A central line is advised and when it is difficult to get, a peripheral line or prolonged course of treatment is needed. Even if the baby is not having a fever (which is a good sign), the antibiotic course needs to be completed, as half a course of antibiotics leads to more complications like drug resistance or partially treated meningitis. If resources are limited in the setting, we also consider clinical findings like if the baby is tolerating feed well, weight gain present, no fever, looking well, and hemodynamically stable. If all are there then usually we consider them. It is possible that not always you get the cause, but when the child is having symptoms, we have to treat it, initially with empiric medication and simultaneously look for the cause.

My physician prescribed me Coversyl 5/2.5 and Concor 5. I am a chronic Coumadin user. Doctor: Hello. There are multiple options available for you. Firstly, it is better to shift to other drugs like Telmisartan 80 mg or Losartan 100 mg instead of Coversyl plus because combination makes it difficult to titrate. If you want to stick to the same then some other medicines like Amlodipine 5 mg and if not effective 10 mg in addition to Coversyl plus and Concor, will control your BP. Also, if BP remains elevated then tablet Prazosin XL 2.5 mg should be added which can be increased to 10 mg if necessary. So, overall, you may have tablet Coversyl plus, Concor and the third drug should be added like Amlodipine 5/10 mg (or similar medicine Cilnidipine). Next in the line if necessary is Prazosin.

If you have got your Mirena inserted within one week of your periods, your Mirena should be working properly providing contraception. If the insertion is after the first week, then there could be chances of pregnancy. Get a pregnancy test done to rule out speculations. Increased frequency of urination could be a symptom of urinary infection, get a urine culture done. Secondly breast tenderness is quite common complaint in ladies after Mirena insertion, that will subside gradually, you may apply ice packs or warm water bag on your breasts to reduce the pain."

According to guidelines when there is a single nodule in the lung of size less than 3 mm we ask to follow up in six months for repeat CT. In the repeat CT, if we find any enlargement of the nodule or any new developments we usually ask for a biopsy of the existing nodule. That is how we practice. So, I think you should repeat your CT after six months and if the size increases, you should get a biopsy done."

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

The pain looks like because of erupting wisdom tooth as you mentioned the hole in the jaw. If the hole is in teeth, it can be acute apical periodontitis. In the former case, you need to take medication like Ofloxacin plus Ornidazole combination twice daily for five days. In the latter case, take Augmentin 625 (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) twice daily for five days. For any confusion, send me a picture I will provide you with a better possible treatment plan. For immediate relief, take Ketorol (Ketorolac) DT tablet, it will provide you with an immediate relief.

My doctor wants me to start medication for HIV, so I am planning to take Genvoya. I am scheduled for an ultrasound and fiber scan for my liver in a month. My concern is starting the medication a right decision for my situation before I know the condition of my liver. I am starting to get a feeling \"do I have the right doctor for me?\" I read about Genvoya and it is saying that it is not recommended for people with severe liver impairment. I do not think I have \"severe liver impairment.\" I need advice. Is my doctor's decision getting hepatitis B before HIV medication is the right choice? Should I just follow my doctor and start medication? Doctor: Hello. I think it is the right decision to vaccinate against hepatitis B because it protects you against future exposures to this virus. Hepatitis B is having the same routes of transmission as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) vaccination. Hepatitis B does not interfere with HIV infection. A CD4 count of less than 500 is an indication to start ARV (antiretrovirals).

He has tried SSRI's which did not work (Then we had the Gene testing done and it showed that he should not be on the one that he was on) and seemed to make him worse. He is now on an SNRI, the same one that his mother is on and that is not working as it should either. We have tried the Ketamine treatments and they seem to help short term (a couple of days). We stop those treatments when he was hospitalized at the end of last year. He was required to be hospitalized to be observed for ECT treatments which were started. We saw a great improvement with the ECT and after about 7 treatments, he was backed off to once a week which seemed to work okay, with only one bad day. Then he was moved to every two weeks and it got bad again. We got him in a few days before the two weeks were up and he still had some very bad days. He is a psychiatrist but my son is not honest with him because he fears being locked up again.  I guess my question is this. What medication in the SNRI class have you found to work the best for major depression? (I know he has been labeled treatment-resistant but the anxiety medication he takes seems to work). Is there another class of medication that you would suggest we try? Doctor: Hello. Firstly sir, it is just a brief labelling to broadly differentiate classes, but many people who do not respond to one SSRI/SNRI, will do well with another drug of the same class, so cross switching between classes is also done. Among the SNRI, my personal experience as well as the literature, supports the use of Venlafaxine as superior compared to others. Lets assume that we are going to use Venlafaxine as a primary drug. In non responders or resistant, usually augmenting agents are given. I do not know what agents have been tried for your son so far. But normally, SNRI with mood stabilizer like Sodium valproate or Lithium, or SNRI+low dose second generation antipsychotic, or SNRI plus combinations of mood stabilizer and low dose antipsychotics can be used. Apart from this other classes of drugs can also help such as Mirtazepine, Bupropion, and as and when needed temporary use of low dose Benzodiazipines and Propranolol can also be added.  The goal here will be remission of symptoms or atleast reduction to an acceptable level. In patients with resistance, usually 2 or 3 drug combinations will be needed. Also many psychiatrists do not reach the maximal dosage recommended of most drugs and that also needs to be tried out. Apart from this, you should consider getting 6 to 8 sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy from a clinical psychologist. It will also help and add to the effect of medicines."

She does not feel any hallucination in her office, but when she reach home she hear somebody is calling her by her name again and again.

As you have mentioned that your sister is suffering from schizophrenia and shown response on the prescribed medication, start her on tablet Risperidone 3 mg at night and tablet Parkin (Trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride - THP) 2 mg in the morning. You can also give her tablet Sizodon plus one tablet at night, which is a combination of both Risperidone 3 mg and THP 2 mg. You can also opt for Risnia liquid; mix 3 mL in her food in dinner, as her compliance is poor for medication. It is Risperidone, which is in colorless and odorless liquid form, so can mix with food easily. No need of Escitalopram.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning.

For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

I can very well understand what you are going through. I will give my best shot to treat your problem. I examined the photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and found the original fungal lesions have been converted to the present appearance because of medicine. It is a common tendency for a person to use local steroids like Quadriderm ointment to get relief quickly. This is when the problem gets complicated. My advice would be to never use such products. But if already used no need to worry. Once a physical examination is done we can find a good solution. My suggestions for you to follow are:"

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I have blood coming in loose stool for the past one year but I do not feel any pain. What is the reason? Doctor: Hi. Blood in stool is not a normal condition as you are having the problem for one year. It should be investigated in detail and the following work-up will be useful. Rectal, anal area examination, stool routine microscopic examination, proctoscopy examination, colonoscopy, if needed. If needed during colonoscopy, biopsy taken from the abnormal area if found for histopathology examination. This work-up will be helpful to rule out causes for blood in stool like a polyp, proctitis, piles, colitis, diverticulitis, any growth, if present, etc. If the color of blood in stool is of brown-red color than bleeding is from the upper gastrointestinal tract. If colour is bright red then the cause for bleeding is from the lower gastrointestinal tract. So, from your provided history, this work-up should be done and above causes should be ruled out. One diagnosis cannot be given. Consult general surgeon or gastroenterologist for examination and above work up and according to cause identified further treatment plan can be decided."

We are badly in need of a baby now. Please suggest some measures to increase the size of my vaginal opening. Thank you. Doctor: Hi. Usually small vaginal opening happens due to dryness of vagina or if you are not fully excited. So, vagina is not dilated and there will be less mucus secretion, which will ultimately cause painful sex (dyspareunia).

We went to our local doctor and he prescribed Paracetamol and one another small tablet. Is it safe taking these medicines during this time? Kindly guide us. Doctor: Hello. If both of you are trying to conceive, then for common cold you may opt for conservative management with Paracetamol tablets for fever and saline warm water gargling thrice a day and steam inhalation twice a day. Also increase her water intake to 12-15 glasses a day, this shall help recover sooner.Paracetamol is safe for pregnancy and is free from any congenital side effects even if you conceive. Secondly, if the fever is not controlled and the cough worsens and sputum becomes yellow, then she can be given a three day course of capsule Azithromycin 500 mg once a day. It is also safe in early pregnancy though should be used restrictively. I believe the other small tablet prescribed to you may be tablet Cetirizine 5 mg twice a day, which is an antihistamine. It can be taken, but not for more than three days.

I do not believe the baby is in my tubes because I have not had any pain. Why my baby cannot be seen on the ultrasound? Doctor: Hello. The possibilities are, 1. Your periods previous to pregnancy was irregular, so what you count as eight weeks maybe less, need to wait and repeat scan after 7 to 10 days. 2. Pregnancy is not healthy. Only if the growth of the baby is normal, the rate of growth of the baby will be regular, and by eight weeks, you should be able to see the baby.You can confirm the health of the baby by checking the serum beta hCG, repeat it after 48 hours, and it should be doubled in 48 hours. For example, if today value is 100 IU/ml, it will be 200 days after and 400 after two more days. If the baby is not healthy, the rise will be less than that. So then repeat it till you can confirm no adequate growth.Only when the beta hCG value is 1500 mIU/mL can a baby be seen on the scan. Do not worry about tubal pregnancy, it will be seen as early as six weeks, and as you said, you would have symptoms much earlier. I hope I have clarified your query.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling.

I would like to know your age and past medical history. I also agree with your doctor on the recommendation for a brain MRI, as it is very important to exclude some of the above possible causes.

My question is: is it safe to be pregnant with an 18 cm spleen? Is there a risk of splenectomy while I am pregnant? Is it safe to be pregnant without a spleen? Doctor: Hello. You are having hemoglobin C hemoglobinopathy leading to hemolysis and hence splenomegaly is present. Your hemoglobin level also should be checked. In this case, as the cell turnover is high, folic acid is prescribed. If splenectomy is done, in pregnancy, there are chances of infections and other complications as per few studies. And also enlarged spleen creates trouble in pregnancy as uterine growth in pregnancy is affected and enough space might not available as the spleen is much enlarged. So, at this point, in my opinion, you should wait for sometime.  And, before planning for conception, consult a gynecologist for examination and discuss these issues and accordingly plan the pregnancy. Take care.

Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you. Doctor: Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

Symptoms you have mentioned are indicating towards gastritis or acid peptic disease. Still, I need more information. Why you underwent GB (gallbladder) surgery? You did not mention the GI series report, it was before the onset of pain or after the onset of pain? Is there a regurgitation of food or vomiting? If yes are there blood in vomit? These kinds of problem is associated with an excess weight. And it is associated with other problems also e.g. NASH (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), metabolic syndrome. Advice. 1. Start on Rabeprazole and Domperidone combination tablet twice a day half an hour before a meal. This will help to alleviate your pain by suppressing acid activity. 2. Take Pepcid (Famotidine) syrup 5 ml along with meals in the initial 10 days of treatment, it will relieve severe pain. 3. Avoid fatty foods. 4. Make a diet chart whatever you are eating in the next seven days, we will modify it. 5. Do exercise to loose weight. Obesity is a known risk factor of these problems and others that I have already mentioned. 6 Get done investigations, CBC (complete blood count), liver function test, lipid profile, fasting and post prandial blood glucose level, and thyroid function tests (T3, T4, TSH).

It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

The primary doctor ordered an ECG and an echocardiogram because of a couple of episodes of near syncope recently. The episodes occur after sudden standing, and we were told it might be due to dehydration and orthostatic hypotension. There is no loss of consciousness and not under any medications. Blood pressure and pulse are listed below. The details of the echo cardiogram are below. The ECG was normal.The echocardiogram reported the following: 1)\tBorderline asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (1.2 cm). 2)\tBorderline enlarged LVOT (LVOT 2.2 cm; LVOT velocity 1.97 m/sec). 3)\tIncreased mitral valve E to A ratio, consistent with the patient\u2019s age. 4)\tTrace-mild pulmonic valve regurgitation. 5)\tThere is an abnormal mosaic pattern over the pulmonic valve areas during the color flow Doppler examination. 6)\tNormal left ventricular, right ventricular, left atrial and aortic root diameters. 7) The ECG is normal.  8) BP when sitting is typically 110/61, with a heart rate between 58 and 64. 9) BP, when lying down, is 87/43, with a heart rate between 42 and 45. My questions are, 1)\tWhat does the echocardiogram mean? What is this likely to be? Is it of short term or long term concern? 2)\tWhat is the least aggressive treatment option? 3)\tWhat is the most aggressive treatment option? Doctor: Hello. 1) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which there is asymmetrical septal hypertrophy. LVOT (left ventricular outflow velocity) velocity is 1.97m/s, so there is no LVOT obstruction. For the long term, we need to do a follow-up echo to see for any increase in the thickness of septum. For a short time, you may need a few more tests for risk stratification like Holter test, tilt table test, and genetic testing for HCM (if available). 2) Treatment options for orthostatic hypotension are increased salt intake, avoiding prolonged standing, few drugs like Fludrocortisone. Aggressive treatment options will depend upon tests reports that are suggested in the first paragraph. 4) The mosaic pattern over the pulmonary valve needs to be correlated with the anatomy of the pulmonary valve and velocity across the pulmonary valve, which is not provided in details."

Diagnosis of your problem and proper treatment has to be started. A beta blocker is effective in lowering fast heart rate but in case of bradycardia, it will further reduce the heart rate. To identify any sinus pause is there or not, Holter monitoring and echocardiography have to be done along with freeT4, T3 and TSH. Sometimes, thyroid function problem may give irregular heartbeat.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I would not suggest you use them. These tablets and syrup are not going to help you to gain weight or muscle building. Betnelan is steroids and it will cause harm to your body in the long run. Steroid work by replacing the testosterone hormone that would normally be produced by the body. Suppression of natural hormones made in the body is the most common side effect of steroid use. Eventually, the body can no longer produce the necessary amounts of testosterone, leaving the body out of its equilibrium state. Long term use of steroid lower body's immunity and lead to infection and other diseases in your body. In order to build muscle and body there is no better way than joining a gym and supplementing it with a diet rich in proteins. Choose high calorific foods like milkshakes, fruits like banana, pineapple, chiku, pear, and dry fruits. Add more protein like peanut, soyabean, pulses, and meat in your diet. Egg and milk are wholesome food. Take them daily. Warm milk before going to bed brings in a healthy and considerable weight gain. Start with smaller proportions initially and gradually increase the intake. It is important to have a balance between exercise and diet for a healthy weight gain."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks.

Doctor: Hello. I went through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and came across a few significant values. Elevated uric acid can increase the risk of kidney stones and joint pains. I would suggest you have plenty of water and avoid having non-vegetarian. Your blood cholesterol is not under control, and increased levels of hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) indicates the risk of heart attack and stroke. Maintain your blood cholesterol in the normal range. Elevated LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) can be observed in many conditions. Liver injury is one of them. Your reports show that in the past you have taken ayurveda treatment for elevated levels of SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) or AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) or ALT (alanine aminotransferase). Hence, the rise of LDH is due to mild persisting liver injury. Low exposure to sunlight has led to low vitamin D.

The only thing in the last bloodwork is I had ANA positive with 1:160 homogenous and the DNA (ds) ABS came out as 11 which said it was positive as well. ESR, creatinine, C3, C4 all come out normal. Can you help shed some light on this? I have been googling and it says I could have an auto immune disease. If so, which ones are likely with this bloodwork? I am currently on Nexium, Xanax and Proair when needed. Doctor: Hi. You have mildly positive antinuclear antibody titer which suggests auto immune disease and Anti-dsDNA (double-stranded DNA) which is slightly above the normal range suggests that you might have SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus) but there are 11 other criterias out of which four should be positive to confirm SLE. People who have positive ANA or Anti-ds DNA but cannot fulfill the clinical criteria for SLE need to be followed closely because they are at risk to develop SLE in the future. SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect almost any organ system. Muscular manifestation includes myalgias as in your case. Titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies often fluctuate with disease activity and are therefore useful in many patients for following the course of SLE. I would suggest you to consult a rheumatologist. You need to take drugs that suppress your immunity. Steroids are the treatment of choice. I would advise repeat testing for both ANA and Anti-dsDNA after one or two months, to look for any change in the titer. Rising titers or very high titers of IgG Anti-dsDNA antibodies are closely associated with impending or already flared SLE. Genetic. Anti-dsDNA and ANA titer. Collagen vascular disease. SLE. Steroids."

Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you. Doctor: Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience. Child will eat properly now as he has recovered from illness."

In the first few months of life, my son was faster than his sister in the growth and everything. And then, it was reversed. I am a graduate of psychology. I have a brother suffering from autism and frankly, I have a fear of this disease. I do not care and I do not want to surrender to delusions. But, mom and dad insist on reminding me of everything you see them that my son is also the possibility of getting hurt. I started since 10 months; I am watching my son very much. I blame him if he did not implement what I am asking. He says dad and mom. He loves to play, laugh and shake hands if I asked him to do so. He looks into my eyes when I talk, but I do not feel that he understands what I am saying to him always. For example, if I asked him to bring me cheesed off the table,\u00a0he does not focus with me and ignore me. On the other hand, if he feels he is thirsty, then he will come to me and say a bottle of water. I know this is probably because the rate of a normal IQ and concentration varies from one to another child. I want a word from the doctor that makes me serenely scream in the face of all of the notes that my son is not normal and I tell them that my son safe and sound. The question is how completely I know that my son is not suffering from any problems in communicating diseases or behavior? Doctor: Hi. I have gone through the query with keen interest and understand your concerns. Before making any opinions I need to inform you that take the things in objective manner and not on emotions I understand there is history of autism in the family and it does not mean your child suffers with autism. In a normal growing child there are many ups and downs and not responding on some occasions is not indicative of serious pathology like autism. We need to take notice that a child plays well with another child, responds to language on most occasions, cheerful, not having any abnormal repetitive stereotyped movements and communicates with the mother. Having said this I feel it will be appropriate to fill a simple questionnaire called Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ). This is a screening instrument for autism and you will know probably with sure that whether there is problem or not. If you still feel there is something abnormal, then you may contact the specialist doctor nearby for a physical evaluation.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

The fact that hCG levels ruled out pregnancy now, of course, confirms the absence of pregnancy. The lactation or as we call it galactorrhea in absence of pregnancy is due to increased serum prolactin levels. Please get her serum prolactin levels checked to rule out hyperprolactinemia. Typhoid can be treated simultaneously with Cephalosporins and Ornidazole with a period of 10 days of treatment. But hyperprolactinemia shall require treatment with Dopamine receptor agonists like Cabergoline which may be given orally at 0.25 mg, one tablet twice a week for four weeks. This should help treat galactorrhea. Also, along with the treatment, one should avoid any form of breast stimulation or foreplay practices which can reciprocally increase the prolactin secretion in feedback.

I usually track ovulation so I know I do ovulate. I recently took a blood test that shows my MCV is 77 and my MCH is 25 both below normal range. My HbA1c was 5.90 and my ALP levels were mildly elevated as well, at 134 (report said it had to be between 42 to 128). My TSH was fine and well within range. My problem is that my follicular phase seems fine but my luteal phase keeps changing. It lasts anywhere between 14 to 18 days. I wonder, is that normal? Do I need to test myself for PCOS? I never had acne problems. I have gained weight, but that is been over five years. I have never missed a period yet. Doctor: Hello. It is really good to know that you are very knowledgeable about your cycle routine. Let me add a few things further into it. The first thing is that the luteal phase is always fixed (14 days) while the follicular phase varies in women's cycle due to hormonal changes in the first half of the cycle. If you want to calculate your ovulation day, then we usually deduct 14 days from the total cycle length. So in your case, your ovulation day is around 14 to 16 depending on if your length is varying between 28 to 30 days in my view. Ovulation on the 12th day is possible in those women who have a cycle length of 26 days. I hope it might have cleared how to calculate ovulation day. Secondly, all your tests are normal, and you have nothing to worry for PCOS as you do not have that because the cycle length of 26 to 35 days is being considered normal for any woman and you are falling in this criteria. I hope this information has helped you. If you require any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact me."

Doctor: Hi, Welcome to the icliniq.com. Your main complaint is pain and fatigue with some gastric issue. Let me know you that excess stress with anxiety can lead to chest pain as well as gastric ulcer. For gastric issue, Pantoprazole tablet can be prescribed for two weeks. If gas excessive then Simethicon containing tablet or syrup can be taken. For stress try to solve problems leading to stress. If exams were not good, you can read well now and can make goals for better reading. Yoga, meditation, and exercise will be having great effect in reducing stress. If panic attacks comes frequently than Fluoxetine like SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) group of drug can be started after doctor consultation. If needed for anxiety issue you can consult a psychiatrist. Here, I do not think you are having any heart problem. If pain is increasing in severity then investigate with EKG (electrocardiography).

Do you get breathing difficulty only when you get cold or have an allergy towards certain things? Asthalin (Salbutamol) syrup is recommended for all types of wheezing. You can take up to 10 ml (2 lids) three times a day. If you get increased heartbeat after taking Asthalin, then we have to change to inhaler form. If not, syrup Asthalin is fine. But there are various other drugs to prevent wheezing episodes. Asthalin can only cure a wheezing episode but cannot prevent it from coming again and again. Take care."

Please note that I had gastritis issue few months back and had taken medication. Could you please answer my questions? Is this something serious issue with liver or gallbladder? I have read that it is a serious issue if bowel color is pale or clay color. Is this related to the same? Is it related to gastritis issue? Is it related to cirrhosis? Please advise. Doctor: Hi. A pale stool is one of the normal variants of stool, though it occurs infrequently. If persistent it indicates an obstruction in the biliary tree leading to stasis of the bilirubin in the liver and causing stool pale. We should think about hepatitis or obstruction of the biliary system at a different level. If this is physiological, it will improve without any specific intervention.  It may or may not be serious, I explained above. It depends on the cause of the pale stool. It is a normal variant or related to biliary disorders. Initially it may not be associated with cirrhosis, later on, in case of long-standing obstruction of the biliary tree, it may cause. Physiological, acute hepatitis, extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Liver function test, complete blood count, amylase, ultrasound abdomen. Continue normal diet. Review back with reports."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am a 19 years old male. I have an abscess on my balls, it is reddish and feels pain, but not much. I have a jock itch right now. I am worried because I saw some terrible pictures on the internet. I think I got bite by something as I mentioned there is an infection near my legs too. I am attaching the photos of the abscess and the jock itch. I had got this from a doctor, for the fungal infection, the doctor may suggest Fluconazole 150 mg to be taken twice in one week, for three weeks. Apply Onabet cream over it twice daily. Do not apply any other cream. For the abscess, you need a course of antibiotics Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid (Augmentin) 625 mg thrice daily for five days. Doctor: Hello. I looked through the photographs. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There is a small pustule in the scrotum and you seem to have a fungal infection in the groin. For the fungal infection take a tablet of Fluconazole 150 mg once followed by the same tablet one week later. Also, wash the area with normal temperature clean water twice daily, and apply Onabet (Sertaconazole Nitrate) or Zimig (Terbinafine Hydrochloride) cream. You may use a mild soap once daily or once every two days. Nextly, for the pustule, apply Mupirocin or Betadine ointment on the pustule after washing it clean and take tablet Augmentin (Amoxycillin and Clavulanic acid) 625 mg tablet twice daily for five days. The infection will subside. I would suggest you take the above medications as described and then review with me after one week. You should be better by then. Also, another suggestion is that you may attend hygiene in that area, especially in the sultry hot climate that provides perfect conditions for bacteria and fungi to grow in the groin area. You could trim the hairs carefully using scissors every week and keep them to a manageable length. Or after trimming you may remove those closely using a body groomer. This will have some benefits like better aeration, easier application of creams and ointments, lesser holding onto sweat and consequently lesser chances of fungal and bacterial infection. I hope this helps."

And i visited a doctor and the medicine i used had cured me. i forgot the medicine tablet taken but had use itraconazole dusting powder and fluconazole lotion. At that time my mother and i have visited the doctor at same time coz she also ha d fungal infection but completely different then mine. Now the current situation is very bad. it is so irritating and itches a lot. but no scaly liquid is coming out now. The same thing now can be seen in my neck and face. Please i need a good dermatologist attention. I am in great suffer in this pandemic and lockdown so i am searching online for medication. I have recently taken arzole capsule once weekly for 3 weeks. And used dipsalic ointment and also clotrimazole cream which shows no better treatment. I was so depressed and used steroid cream called dermicom oc plus only two times as it shows some severe bad red rash so i discontnued it. I live in hot and humid climate and had wore tight clothes in past. The area of rash is always at little more tempreature. Doctor: Hi. Thanks for sharing your query. You seem to be very distressed by the problem. As I can see in the picture it is Tinea. Since it is extensive it is important to start proper treatment with oral antifungals for a good length of time to clear the infection. You have been using steroid creams which is going to worsen the infection and make it spread further. So you should stop using dipsalic and other steroid applications and start proper treatment. You should get your LFT and KFT done and you can follow up with dermatologist. Usually itraconazole or terbinafine are given orally along with some creams like luliconazole or sertaconazole, etc. Itching can be controlled with antiallergics. Treatment of family members with infection is equally important. Let me know if you have more queries Hope this helps."

However, Pantoprazole may cause some times such symptoms. I think the boil itself can cause the myalgia and there is nothing serious. You need to complete at least three days of antibiotics because once you stop these medicines the symptoms will also resolve.

As per details provided by you regarding your diagnosis, such patients tend to have difficulty in attention and concentration along with difficulty in facing social situations and anhedonia.

At that time, it looked fine and till now, she had no pain or any sensitivity issues in eating. But off late, the color of the chipped tooth has turned green. We consulted two dentists, first one was a specialist in child dentistry and recommended an RCT treatment wherein a chemical will be placed to cure the infection. He said that the discoloration will increase with time and this baby tooth might fall off much earlier (in 4 to 5 years) than the expected time (6 to 8 years). The other dentist recommended to observe for six months and see if any rash or boil is developed above the gums and any kind of pain is experienced. He also said that such a tooth might fall off before time. We are confused as to what we should do? If RCT is the way out then we would prefer to get it done before she starts with her formal schooling at 3. But we are mainly concerned if she could endure such a treatment as she is very small. Please provide suggestion. I have attached a photo of the X-ray. Doctor: Hi.  I got your chief complaint and opinions of two dentists. As far age is concerned, your daughter still is in need of these teeth as permanent teeth take time to erupt, by 6 to 7 years they will erupt. Till then, healthy front teeth are important otherwise she will develop irregular teeth later. As tooth has changed color so it is better to act on the suggestions of pedodontist and go for pulpectomy or RCT. It will keep the tooth intact and prevent formation of any cyst later. There is nothing wrong with it and there are modern gadgets to do the procedure, she will not feel any kind of pain during the procedure. If you leave it as such, it will weaken with time and may later contribute to huge financial burden to treat irregular teeth."

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Is there any precautions to avoid genetic problems for my baby or do we need to take any medication or treatment for a child. Please suggest with a better solution. Doctor: Hi. It would be better if you would send me the background of your question. Any specific family history like thyroid, diabetes or any congenital anomalies, thalassemia, sickle cell disease or any other family history, then it needs precautions and even investigations. The severity of diseases also matters. Either it is dominant or recessive in both sides blood relations as dominant will give dangerous effects as compared to recessive. Check blood group as well as if you are Rhesus negative and he is positive, then there could be a risk of development of autoantibodies and hemolysis. So check the above family history that matches his and yours can affect your offspring strongly if any."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,  Just wondering what type of impression I will need to get if I have to get crowns on last teeth. Like will it be a full top impression or can they do it off just those two teeth? Doctor: Hi. Regarding the impression making, the material is chosen depending on what it is being used for. As you have already mentioned that the purpose is to fabricate crowns, the best material to opt for is the rubber impression material (elastomeric silicone impression materials). The advantage of the material is the high accuracy of the details and it allows sufficient time for duplicating the teeth model. Talking about the number of teeth involved during an impression making, usually, it is the whole arch involving all the teeth. That is the routine way of doing it. But there are disposable sectional double impression trays available which help the dentist to make an impression in a particular region along with the opposing teeth. The biggest plus with these trays are firstly preventing contamination because it is used only once and for a single patient. Secondly, upper and lower teeth with the bite are registered in one impression hence time-saving. The maximum number of teeth involved in these kinds of impressions would be four to five but definitely not just two teeth. I personally make double tray impressions on a routine basis for crown fabrications. But,it totally depends on the dentist's well and wish to choose the technique according to his/her skills and economic reasons."

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

So, I could not concentrate on my studies due to depression. My thoughts are going to it even though I try to control. I want to not be depressed but I do not know why it is happening, my heart is paining a lot whenever I am depressed. I am facing these issues from childhood, so before when I am a teenager, whenever I was depressed, I started masturbating but I started getting addicted to masturbating. After that, I realized that it is a bad thing. So I stopped it. But now am depressing a lot as my love is failed, parents pressure on goals, so my depression is at peak. I was stressed a lot. I want to masturbate but I do not want to start it again as I was feeling shame and shy of doing it. So my depression was not cured, it hurts me a lot. I want to use pills but I do not know to whom I should tell my problem. I am feeling nice when I masturbate but it is wrong so please show the right way to solve my problem. Doctor: Hello. I can figure out that the whole problem is love here. Let me tell you in this way. See people have a wrong belief that love is only once. Love is always alive within us because we first love our mother, then father, then toys, then games, then school, then friends, then girls, then the job, then money, etc. The list keeps moving but it is our inner block which does not allow us to move further. We need to understand that when time do not stop nothing stops. If we stop people will go ahead of us. Today's world is full of competition and if we are delayed we are at loss. Forget about movies. Movies are just a story. But I see that movies spoil our life and make us helpless. When celebrities can do love, sex and betrayal then we are fine we should also be one of them. That is human nature. Love is like a mobile. We buy one which is best, next year still the best come and it keeps following. Do we stick to depression? No, right? Then we need to move. everything updates even the android and iOS software for gadgets. Something like that our life we should take. Marriage is just a social show off. We do get married and have sex. Nothing else. Our life has been constantly changing. We finish studies, struggle for jobs, then salary, then buying house, then car, then marriage, then kids and much more. Nothing is easy. We should be hard rock internally. I should share my personal experience in the last 12 years. I was depressed once upon a time, I needed a psychiatrist for myself. But I understood that until I rise nothing can help me, no one can help me. I need to move I need to be strong and I need to be practical. I Will advice you to not masturbate because if you do then you lose your energy of the body and please understand that we are all with one time growing till 18 to 20 years of age. Then we are not going to grow but going to get aged. We will get blood pressure, diabetes, pain, and aches and we will forget anything about love. We will only wait when life will end. Things happen this way only. I will even request you to go for some old age home. Ask their experience with lives. You will really feel so relaxed that life is nothing but just to pass with time. I hope you will become positive and take the decision in life to accept challenges. Because if we accept challenges then we enjoy more and more. If there is no failure in life we will never know what success is. Let us keep the ego, attitude, and anger in us alive to achieve the best for us in life. Think over it."

The history you give is suggestive of a condition called a chalazion (inflammation of sebaceous glands in the lid) which is typically painless. Secondly, it could also be an internal hordeolum (infection in the meibomian glands of the lid) which is generally associated with pain, and it being on the inner side of the lid is not visible externally. The treatment for a chalazion is generally conservative, which requires repeated applications of hot fomentation with a mild lid massage for at least two weeks. If this does not resolve still, you may need a small surgical procedure to get it drained. On the other hand, an internal hordeolum will require a short course of oral antibiotics and topical antibiotic ointments along with anti-inflammatory painkillers, supplemented with hot fomentation and lid massage.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just keep in mind that your sugar level must not go down, do not reduce your insulin dosage. Also never skip a meal, if you skip a meal you will tend to indulge more calories in the next meal. Include more protein rich food, protein, and fiber rich meals will bring early satiety and will easily help build in more muscles than fat. I hope this helps."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am 20 years old. I have a 2-year-old kid. I currently have the nexplanon implant birth control. I had a pregnancy scare a month ago but started my period finally. The day after my period stopped is when intercourse happened. Two days after that I woke up and I had a little bit of blood in my discharge my cramps were scattered through out the day I thought I was fine though. The next morning I woke up with bad cramps. I felt a trickle down my leg so I rushed to the bathroom and I was bleeding. The bleeding has slowed down since morning and my cramps went from morning to evening in pain. On my mother's side, we have miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, tubal pregnancies, but no one on my father's side has had any problems with getting pregnant. Also, the nexplanon increases your chance of having an ectopic pregnancy. So I was wondering what this seemed? Should I worry? or is it just me getting my period again? What should I do about it? Please suggest. Doctor: Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Considering the fact that you are using nexplanon, it is unlikely that the bleed would be probably due to pregnancy or even ectopic simply because nexplanon is a progesterone implant which prevents ovulation, make the endometrial lining unsuitable for the implant and increases tubal motility with thickening of cervical mucous making it difficult for sperms to penetrate through. Hence pregnancy seems unlikely.  Postcoital bleeding as noticed in your case could possibly be due to cervical erosions or ectopy, which can be possibly caused by an HPV (human papilloma virus) infection or after a rough sexual episode as well. But in either case, a per speculum exam is required along with a pap smear test and an ultrasound pelvis as well to rule out any organic cause. It is not your menses for sure. So advise would be to visit your physician for a local exam first."

I am on 5 Progynova tablets three times a day plus Oestrogel in the evening. I also had a GSCF. Is this high dose okay? My lining is 7.7 mm and the doctor has advised embryo transfer on day 55. Is doing an embryo transfer on day 55 okay? I would be very grateful if you could advise me on this. I am 37 years old and had two failed embryo transfers a year ago. Doctor: Hi. Progynova or Estradiol valerate of up to 8 mg per day is fine. Dose is high, but may be needed to improve endometrium to a minimum of 7 mm. Any thickness of 7 to 14 mm is normal. I could not get what day 55 is. We can transfer in just normal periods or after downregulating with Lupreolide daily injections. So if you have had natural cycle transfer previously, maybe this time try Lupreolide this time. It will suppress all disturbances from your body hormones. Maybe another option is add Ecospirin, Nitric oxide donor or Sildenafil or best and most physiological method is to use HMG (Menotropin) injections. Endometrium will improve very well. Hope infections have been treated and blood sugar and thyroid, prolactin levels are normal. All the best.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am a 41-year-old male. I have been experiencing muscle spasms and pain in the back, neck, and leg since 10 years intermittently. I am currently undergoing physical therapy and chiropractic. However, I wanted to consult from a naturopathic perspective on what can be the root cause of these problems. I have undergone medical tests, blood test and urine test. Everything indicates normal parameters. Body weight and height ratio is normal as well. I do moderate or light exercises and consume healthy diet and multivitamin. However, I have been plagued by muscle sprains or spasms. Sometimes on feet or leg and other times on back or neck. I am looking for a solution to this problem. Doctor: Hi. I looked at your laboratory report, and that is absolutely within the normal range (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I wonder whether your occupation or daily activities cause more stress to your neck and back muscles. If so, you may reduce giving stress by that activities. For example, if you sit and work on laptop continuously, neck muscle get stressed. In that case, relax neck in between. You may take help from physiotherapist to relax those muscles. The other chance is chair and bed. You need to maintain the straight back spine while sitting and sleeping. Sitting straight (no bending the back forward) is important. Choose a chair that makes your spine erect and sit. Keep the neck straight. Even people having a belly, the spine bends to produce back pain. If your back is already not straight, then use pillow support while sitting. While sleeping, please make sure the bed is not having the cushion effect to make pits against your back. It should be the flat and hard, which will maintain the natural spine alignment/posture. Avoid pillow to head. Raising head by pillow will cause more stretch-stress to neck muscles. Keep small round pillow around the neck that needs support. You may also take a small towel to roll and keep under the neck, at any cost the head should not be raised. This is how you can prevent neck, hand and back pain associated with irregular posture. Yoga also helps in relieving back and neck muscle stress. Before going to bed, you can apply aromatic oils or herbal pain relieving oils to back and neck. Do self-massage with hands. Then apply hot water to it. This heat application at night will prevent morning stiffness or pain. Each joint is capable of moving in different direction, but in day-to-day life we do limited movements. If you start the yoga practice, that enables all joints to be moved in all possible directions, thus reduce the pain due to non-using the joint. The next possibility is cervical and lumbar spine degeneration, that leads to local structural alteration which will compress the nerves to cause pain. If any issues with intervertebral discs (bulging, prolapse or inflammation), that also compress the nerves to cause pain. These can be diagnosed by X-ray or CT scan. If you consult an orthopedic physician, they will diagnose. If this is the cause of your pain, then physiotherapist can give appropriate therapy.

In the follow-up visit, the doctor found that her vision came down than earlier and the\u00a0pressure raised to 40. He suggested an emergency MRI scan of the head, and it was normal. Then he suggested Travatan and Combigan and no cause identified. All these reports shared with our primary care doctor, and he advised to make another visit to the\u00a0eye doctor and a neurologist checkup. As per his suggestion, we had another follow-up visit, and nothing found abnormal. They wanted to wait for a neurologist check, and until then my wife was asked to continue Travatan and Combigan. The report says everything is normal, but nothing is improved on her vision side. Can you please suggest us what we should do now? Doctor: Hello. I understand your concern. Please do not worry. In my opinion, there are two issues. It can be a POAG, primary open angle glaucoma and the treatment is antiglaucoma medicine. If the pressure is normal and optic disc is normal, then glaucoma is under control, and it is not the cause of low vision. There is a very low vision in the left eye with RAPD (relative afferent pupillary defect) in left eye along and temporal pallor of the optic disc. It is suggestive of optic disc pathology and most likely optic neuritis (retrobulbar neuritis). The treatment plan is as follows. MRI with contrast is the ideal investigation to look for demyelinating lesions in the brain as well as on optic nerve. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, we start high dose Methylprednisolone intravenously. Here, the prognosis is good, but some patients do not improve.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

What to do next, to make the UTI stop from recurring? Are there any medications or lifestyle changes to me made? I hope to hear from you soon. Doctor: Hello. As you have already mentioned, sexual activity is a risk factor for UTI. A urine analysis report done during the UTI (urinary tract infection) episode, will give us a better picture of the number of pus cells. I request you to share two such reports of tests done during two different episodes. Due to the short length of the urethra, the bacteria of the perineum are inevitably introduced into the bladder. But, these bacteria should not be allowed sufficient time in the bladder to grow. Some females are more prone to UTI compared to others due to a different antigen expression on the bladder mucosa.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods? Doctor: Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Is it okay to continue this? Doctor: Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

My gynecologist and PCP both felt a large mass on the right side of thyroid and told me that they have to refer me out and I need another biopsy. The last biopsy was a year back and it was benign. It was a solid dense nodule measuring 1.3 cm. All thyroid tests are normal. Can mixed spongiform nodules be malignant if they are hypoechoic, vascular, lobular and with peripheral calcification? I cannot find anything regarding other abnormal feature with mixed spongiform nodules. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it appears that you have a thyroid nodule. According to the guidelines, if the nodule is more than 75 % of spongiform appearance, then they are benign and if less than 75% then there is a chance of malignancy which must be confirmed by FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology). In your ultrasound, there is no percentage depiction of the spongiform portion. Secondly, the malignant nodule has hypoechogenicity and microcalcifications which is present in your report. Please, it is my advice to you to not come to any conclusion before an FNAC. For more information consult an endocrinologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/endocrinologist"

Are there any home remedies and is it normal? Doctor: Hello. Constipation is very common due to the active lifestyle considering your age and history. The blood in stools can be due to chronic constipation. As it does not pain while you pass stool it confirms constipation. To prevent constipation you should drink more water, considering summer season 3 to 4 liters should be good. Include fiber rich food like oats, corn flakes, and fruits like banana, apple, and watermelon. Try having some of these food for dinner. And if you eat nonvegetarian foods make sure you eat an equal amount of green vegetables with it. On an Indian diet, you can have roti instead of white rice. Following this routine would surely improve your constipation."

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy.

From your experience, can you please tell me the biggest lesson or insight that you would have learned after treating such patients? How should I prepare myself to manage such patients? What advice will you give others about dealing with someone who has this diagnosis? Doctor: Hello. Social anxiety disorder is one of the anxiety spectrum disorders. Here, persistent anxiety in social situations like talking with a person or a group of people, in group presentations, in talking with the opposite sex, etc., are found. Avoiding social gathering and social situations are most commonly seen. Accepting that one has social anxiety is one of the most important things to deal with. The sufferer should be made comfortable that this is a disorder like any other disorder. With proper medicines and behavior therapy, most of the individuals show improvement. The patient should be educated properly regarding this illness. Social anxiety is one of the disabling conditions, and early treatment helps in the early response to therapy. The patient should be given proper support and should be made aware that others are not judging him. This is the most important step in the management. Relaxing prior to any anxiety provoking situation helps to yield best results. There is no need to make any specific preparations. Once the provisional diagnosis of social anxiety is made, then the patient is encouraged to speak without hesitation. Building up a rapport takes time in such situations, but once it is built, then the interview goes easy.

Citalopram tablets are recommended to be administered as a single daily dose either in the morning or evening. The usual dose is 20 mg daily but can go up further up to 40 mg daily. I presume you have been prescribed Citalopram to manage depression or anxiety or related emotional disorders. Can I clarify why you want to split the dose? If you are experiencing any side-effect like sedation you can take the dose at night time. How long have you been on Citalopram? Usually, you will get used to the medication by two weeks or so. If side effects are persistent and severe, kindly review with your prescribing doctor. Anecdotally, I have seen a few patients taking Citalopram twice daily instead of once daily. They have responded fine without any adverse effects. But once daily dosage is the well studied and recommended dosage plan."

Over the past five years, I have become around 50 pounds overweight and all of my attempts to lose have seemed to fail so I have given up, but my weight has stayed the same. There is so much information put there about losing weight with hypothyroidism but it all seems to conflict. I am so unsure as to what type of exercise and diet I should follow as a result but I still would like to lose weight, but most importantly have my body feel better. What can I do? I am currently on Levothyroxine, Buspar, and Benedryl. Doctor: Hi. You have really done well with the hypothyroidism problem. Your levels are normal with less medications which are very good. As it is genetically induced, it is very difficult to lose weight. My advice to you is, you should focus on maintaining normal levels of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and try to remain active, having a positive outlook in life. Or else, it will become very difficult to balance your life with the symptoms of hypothyroidism. Even though your weight has not reduced, be very careful in not putting on weight here afterward. Everyday brisk walking for 1 hour. If you have body pain, alternate with exercises and walking. Avoid all kinds of junk foods, processed, bakery products, rich sweets, fatty foods, sodas, alcohol, and smoking. Avoid partying and binge eating. Follow the food timings properly. Have small frequent meals. In between snacks should be strictly fruits or any kind of low-calorie foods. Have unsalted nuts around five daily. It can give a glow to your dry skin. Everyday water intake should be around 1.5-2 liters. You can use flax seeds. Powder it and mix it in your food. It is a fiber which will give you fullness. Use turmeric, fenugreek seeds, or powder every day. It is a good antioxidant and fenugreek helps in reducing cholesterol levels. Include low-fat milk, curd every day. Egg white, lean chicken, or fish can be taken daily in moderation (anyone). Organ meats need to be avoided. Is your menstrual cycle normal? Please get back if you have any other complaints.

Right now, I am taking tablet Levera XR 750 mg once daily. Sometimes, when I sit for a long time that too only when I use the Indian style toilet and sit for a long time like 15 minutes, I feel dizziness as if I was going to fall. This feeling will be there only for about 5 seconds, and after that, I will be normal. When I go out in the sun and come back, I feel the same. Is it due to the tablet or any other reason? I am very much worried about that. Doctor: Hi. Dizziness that you are having is a very normal phenomenon, which occurs in a large number of normal individuals. It may happen while standing from sitting position, because of a relatively low cerebral perfusion (blood supply to the brain) for a few seconds. It is during these few seconds when autonomic nervous system adapts itself to bring the cerebral perfusion pressure to normal. It is in those few seconds that such a feeling of dizziness occurs. Coming from sunlight to indoor may cause a similar physiological phenomenon and hence the dizziness. So, keep yourself hydrated well. Drink at least 3 to 4 liters of fluids per day, and these symptoms should improve. Clinically, tablet Levera (Levetiracetam) does not cause such effects. It is just a theoretically listed side effect, but not observed clinically. This tablet is not causing it. This is the safest antiepileptic drug. Please do not worry and continue the same treatment. It is a normal phenomenon."

I am worried she missed something and I did not get the opportunity to ask questions. I am currently on Ventolin asthma inhaler, Vitamin D, and Daily iron tablet. Doctor: Hello, Welcome to the icliniq.com. Following is my opinion about your asked question. Your two rounds of CBC (attachment removed to protect patient identity), showing high total WBC (white blood cells) count and high neutrophils. Immature granulocytes are elevated slightly. The inflammation, infection, excess stress, etc like causes might be responsible for that. In the second CBC (complete blood count), count decrease and neutrophils also reduced in number. Hence it does not look like leukemia or blood cancer. Immature granulocyte can be increased slightly in any inflammation. Your count and differential count are not to the level suggestive of leukemia. So it does not seem to be blood cancer as per my opinion. Kindly repeat CBC with peripheral smear examination after a few days. The value will fall within range after a few days. I hope this helps."

When we control our blood sugar strictly, we may postpone getting the kidney problem for many years. But if we do not control our blood sugar level strictly, we may get kidney problem soon. The point is, all diabetic people will get a kidney problem. It is only a matter of time. But there are some ways to prevent worsening of kidney problem. The blood sugar must be well below the normal levels. So please take care of your father's blood sugar level and control it, then the creatinine value may go back. Each laboratory has their own normal range based on the reagents and types of tests they do. See what is the normal range given for creatinine. If the normal range is more than 1.4, then no need to be afraid. Since he is also having heart problems, I want to ask you a few questions: 1. Is he having swelling in both legs? 2. Is he having difficulty in breathing even doing his routine activities? 3. Is he passing less urine? 4. Is he already on tablets which increases urination like Lasix or Dytor? If he is not on Lasix or Dytor and he is having swelling, we can start tablet Lasix which reduces the load to heart and kidney. I want to suggest a drug which prevent kidney failure. Please ask your father to start tablet Nefrosave twice a day after food which is good for kidneys. It can be taken with other tablets.

Left eye pain and hot feeling in your head is due to severe mechanical stress to your body because of extreme mental exertion and lack of sleep for three days. As a neurologist, my first advice will be to take some rest and be relaxed and calm. To take rest and enough sleep at least five to six hours in a day is a part of exam preparation. Sleep is a must for better and powerful performance in an exam. It will refuel and restart our brain. Sleep will help to build up and potentiate our memory. So as first advice, please maintain sleep hygiene. And take five to six hours of sound sleep in a calm, cool, and dark room. Take food on time. At present, all your symptoms are due to the same. 1) Take cold water shower. 2) Go to bed and try to sleep. 3) If still, you have problems, you can take medicine to calm down your mind like tablet Etizola (Etizolam) 0.25 mg one tablet immediately.

What could be done to prevent cycle delay? How to resolve this PCOS problem? My gynecologist prescribed Gynex syrup and Ovalife tablets for three months. However, I have not started yet. Please provide a second opinion. Doctor: Hi. I have seen your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). According to the ultrasound report, it is PCOS only (polycystic ovarian syndrome). All other tests ordered are normal. To confirm this by hormonal correlation, you need to get your FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (Luteinizing hormone) levels done on day 2 of cycle. It is the reversal of this ratio in PCOS. You may take Ovalife tablet. It is just a supplement. PCOS is not a disease, but just hormonal imbalance. You are a lean PCOS as you are very thin with a BMI of 23. Try to maintain your weight by a good and balanced diet and regular exercise. For reduction of acne and maintaining regularity of your cycles, I suggest tablet Diane 35 (Ethinyl estradiol) once a day for 21 days starting from day 2 of the cycle. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. However, regarding acne, your male hormone testosterone levels and also free insulin levels are within normal range and probably not the cause of acne. Consult a dermatologist for acne.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am a 24-year-old female. My weight is 57 kg, height is 163 cm. My complaint is face chubbiness, and I gained about 5 kg for the past 6 months, and the main problem is that I am missing my menses this month. My LMP was on 15th April. As per gynecologist advise I did CBC, fasting sugar, TSH, prolactin, HCG, total testosterone, DHEAS, FSH, LH, USG pelvis for PCOD. Doctor advised to take Primolut N but I have not yet started the tablet. Do I need to start that and what is the line of treatment? All reports were normal except the two TSH -13.740, DHEAS-53.19. Please help. Doctor: Hello. Yes, you can take the Primolut N tablet as advised by your gynecologist. As your periods have gotten delayed by almost more than 45 days, it is unlikely that they would come naturally, even if it does, it may not be similar to your natural menstrual pattern, this is because this is an anovulatory cycle (meaning no ovulation must have occurred in this cycle). Usually, when periods come after such a delay, it could range from spotting to scanty flow to excess flow, or sometimes prolonged bleeding which may need hormonal medications to stop the bleeding. I would like to know if you face any acne or unwanted facial hair growth problems, if so, then you must be having PCOS (even if the USG is normal). And yes, you definitely need to start treatment for your hypothyroidism as your TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level is high. Thyroid hormonal disturbance are quite common with PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), and also it can disturb the menstrual pattern too. So, definitely you need to start your thyroxine replacement medications. DHEAS (dehydroepiandrosterone) is low, so there is nothing to worry about that. As you complained about weight gain over the recent few months, it would be advisable to reduce your weight, do regular exercises, and eat a proper healthy diet. I hope this helps."

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

He says he spits out mixture and not to swallow. Is this even possible or safe especially since dental work is so expensive? Doctor: Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I appreciate you for such an interesting question on dental health.  Talking about the two chemical components separately. Baking soda is found to be a great alternative in whitening the teeth as it has mild abrasive quality. It is also found that baking soda has seven on the RDA scale (radioactive dentin abrasion) compared to the regular toothpastes which ranges 200-300. Just a sprinkle of it on the toothpaste in your regular brushing helps in whitening the teeth. But this is not proved on the papers by research.  Coming to Trisodium phosphate, it is one of the ingredients present in less percentage in the toothpastes which is chemically basic and removes stains. But it is a commercial agent used as degreaser and stain remover otherwise.  The problem using these chemicals in dental cleaning is that you will not be sure how much percentage of the active chemical components you expose on the tooth surfaces in the DIY (do it yourself) project. These might see effective but lack of studies and research making it unsuitable for daily usage. No standardization, therefore not used as commonly as a toothpaste. Also, continuous and prolonged exposure of these on the teeth might end up in roughness of the enamel and a hence weaker teeth.  I hope this helps."

Some blood started flowing, and the pain is more. I think that there are infections and something more dangerous because the blood has not stopped. Please help. Doctor: Hi. As you have rightly put it, there is a possibility of recurrent fungal infection what we call as otomycosis. This condition is very notorious for its recurrence even after treatment. Usually, usage of earbuds i.e. q-tip initiate the entire problem as often the cotton tip is not sterilized in a proper manner thereby introducing infection. The entire fungal blob can obstruct your ear canal, and you will have fullness along with itching and associated pain. It is very essential that the fungal blob be suctioned out completely not leaving backtraces of fungal hyphae as they can form another colony in no time. I recommend you to see an ENT to get this entire blob suctioned out. Continue to use the antifungal ear drops (I usually recommended a combination containing Clotrimazole as it is the most effective in treating such conditions). It will take a while before your ear gets back to normal and there is nothing you need to get stressed about as it is a very common entity we encounter in the outpatient department.

In the mid of last month when I was cleaning the area, I noticed it starting to burn around the bottom swelling area. During those couple of days, I saw the swelling lightly increase. It is now late and have not seen any drop of swelling and worried that this would never heal. Also, my tip area has some light swelling which has not changed for the past eight weeks (it was pretty bad for the first two weeks). My erection last month did not hurt, but now when I get erections, I have some discomfort due to the dryness or redness. I saw my doctor last week who did the surgery, which he did not say much. I am attaching photos on how it looked last month and how it looks now. The picture with the stitches is what it was last month. If you can help me answer the questions below, that will be great since I am stressing out. Is it normal to see this type of swelling behavior? Is it normal to have swelling around the tip? Is this expected healing based on my current photos and healthy to see swelling for three months? I started having a burning sensation which is on and off after I cleaned the area, I am assuming this is just from the irritation that I caused? When I elevate my penis when I get out of the shower, the glands and swelling area look white or tan like it is almost healed, and I see a slight decrease in swelling, is this a good sign? Can I have swelling for this great cause any long term complications or there is nothing I should be worried about? My Glands looked dry and slight red and cracked. Is applying sensitive lotion safe to this area and will it help heal? Doctor: Hello. 1. Yes, it is reasonable to have this much swelling, which will resolve over time 2. Yes, it is usually expected to heal. 3. Yes, the burning sensation is due to irritation. 4. The appearance of tan following shower has nothing to do with healing. This is due to moisture following the shower. 5. The swelling is unlikely to cause any long term complications. 6. The cracks in the skin are due to dryness, and applying lotion is not harmful.

The information and opinions are mind-numbing and confusing. I have the choice of taking my daughter to a pediatrician or a psychiatrist, after having her tested by a psychologist for school performance related issues. The resulted report indicates that she has serious trouble in concentrating (we knew that) and that she is exhibiting anxiousness (we knew that too). She is currently taking 20 mg Ritalin LA, and we need to re-evaluate the medication.In your professional opinion, where should one start? Will it be sufficient taking her to a pediatrician to re-evaluate the medication, or should I take her to a child psychiatrist for a full evaluation? Doctor: Hello. You have asked a very pertinent question. I am not sure about the medical system in your area. Usually, young children in primary school are seen by pediatricians. Once they move to secondary school and if they have any co-morbid conditions like depression or anxiety, they are usually seen by child psychiatrists. But this arrangement is not universal, and there are huge variations. Both developmental pediatricians and child psychiatrists have the training and expertise to assess and manage ADD or ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder). So if you are comfortable with your current pediatrician, discuss your concerns with him or her about your daughter's anxiety. If appropriate, they can refer your daughter to a child psychiatrist. Perhaps your daughter's response to Ritalin LA (Methylphenidate) and tolerability needs to be reviewed, and dose has to be titrated accordingly. If there are any emotional difficulties, she will benefit from pastoral support at school or some counseling. If emotional problems are severe, getting a child psychiatrist opinion may be sensible. Also, we have to remind ourselves that the management of ADD or ADHD is not medication alone. Your daughter will benefit from individualized support to help with her school performance. Her self-esteem should not be affected by ADD. Let her enjoy doing activities which can provide positive experiences. If she likes sports or drama or any other similar field, let her have regular time for pursuing her interests."

We consulted few doctors, some are saying the immediate operation is needed otherwise it will be cancerous and some are saying no immediate action is required. She is having pain in her right side of the upper abdomen and also in the middle. I am attaching her ultrasound report. Please tell me about her condition. During this pandemic, we are not able to go outside and consult the doctor. Doctor: Hello. I can understand your concern about symptoms complex and ultrasound findings and whether surgery is the answer to your problem. Well, first of all, I want to clear that you do not have stones in the gallbladder. They are concretions. It is a medical term and they are called microlithiasis (gall bladder stones less than 3 mm in size). So the possibility of developing cholecystitis (gall bladder inflammation) is very low. However, this microlithiasis can cause pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas which is a gland sitting over the back of the abdomen). Thirdly, the pain can be secondary to the functional gall bladder problem, where the gall bladder is naturally slow resulting in damping of bile (yellow secretion produced by the liver and stored within gallbladder) and production of small concretions such as in y our case. So I would ask you to get a few blood tests to confirm whether you have pain due to pancreatitis. I also want that you should discuss to me in more detail about your pain, as only proper history can give me a clue towards your problem whether gall bladder inflammation, pancreatitis, or functional gall bladder disorder even before any further testing. Since the ultrasound findings and your symptoms are not correlated very well, there is no point in discussing the role of surgery. But I just want to assure you that you probably need no surgery, so do not worry about it. I suggest you some tests, please get it done, then I would recommend you some lifestyle changes and a medical treatment that can help you resolve your minor stones within the gallbladder. I hope this helps. Pancreatitis. Cholecystitis. Peptic ulcer disease. Functional gallbladder disorder (gallbladder dyskinesia). Complete blood count. Serum amylase and lipase. Liver function tests. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). Start capsule Esomeprazole 40 mg half an hour before meals once daily for now. Follow up after investigation."

I keep waking up in a cold sweat and feeling like my dream has actually happened. Doctor: Hi. Dream interpretation is not a reliable science branch yet. Many types of research have been done on dream interpretation but there are no conclusions yet as to what suggests what. Some researchers say dreams have no purpose or meaning and are nonsensical activities of the sleeping brain. Others say dreams are necessary for mental, emotional, and physical health. Studies have shown the importance of dreams to our health and well-being. In one study, researchers woke subjects just as they were drifting off into REM sleep. They found that those who were not allowed to dream experienced: Increased tension, anxiety, depression, difficulty concentrating, lack of coordination, weight gain, tendency to hallucinate. Nightmares, or bad dreams, are common in children and adults. Often nightmares are caused by: Stress, conflict, and fear, trauma, emotional problems, medication or drug use, illness. If you have a recurring nightmare, your subconscious may be trying to tell you something. Listen to it. If you cannot figure out why you are having bad dreams, and you continue to have them, I can help you figure out what is causing your nightmares and provide tips to put you at ease. In your case, you must be having an emotional issue with your friend and you are stressed due to that. Keep in mind that no matter how scary a nightmare is, it is not real and most likely will not happen to you in real life. Therefore, do not worry about any dreams at all. Worry may further stress you and may sometime make you be obsessive on those thoughts which may further develop into depression. Ignore those dreams. Engage in your day to day activities. Increase your physical activity level so that you sleep well and sound at night. Take care."

I tried to remove possible stones but ended up making my tonsil bleed every time I try to clean possible stones and gargled with salt and water. I am really afraid it is something bad. I am 24 years old. Doctor: Hello. Your tonsil looks infected (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I can see pus coming out of your tonsil. You complete the course of Augmentin (take it for seven days, 1 gm 12 hourly). Along with that take plenty of fluids (at room temperature i.e. not very cold and not very hot), do mouth gargles (combination of Chlorhexidine and Benzydamine) three times daily for five days which will soothe your throat as well as remove debris from the crypts. Take proton pump inhibitor (Pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily on empty stomach for a week) and also Paracetamol 650 mg thrice daily for three days. Do take all the medicines, just Augmentin is not enough. Do not touch your tonsils and do not try to remove the debris with fingers. Also, if possible send more pictures of your throat. I want to see your right tonsil and posterior pharyngeal wall clearly."

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I would advise you to stop being judgmental about yourself and stop being bothered about how the world judges you. From the description which you have provided, I can say that you are having adjustment disorder and nothing else.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

There are significant blockages. The medicine he is receiving is fine and should be continued until bypass surgery. Regarding, bypass or angioplasty. Immediately after the attack, say within 24 hours, if you do angioplasty, then it is beneficial for the patient as it can be done on an urgent basis, and shorter the time interval between attack and either procedure, more is the benefit. This benefit is for 24 to 48 hours. But at this stage, since this crucial time period has already passed, there is no urgency. He should undergo bypass surgery as he is having too many blockages and stenting will not be possible at all these places. So, discuss with the cardiac surgeon regarding bypass.

The results were very good and the anxiety and accompanying depression went away. Now I cannot do anything without medication because the last case happened to me when I had withdrawn the medication (Paxil 10 mg daily for 4 years) and got that relapse, so how can I tune the medications for extended usage? (i.e, which one to cancel or decrease or increase or keep the three but modify the doses) What do you suggest? Please I cannot do without medications? Is it true that the effect of these medications become weak or insignificant with time (i.e, during the usage, work only for limited time then stop working although the person continues to use it). Doctor: Hi. At first I would like to tell you briefly about Generalized Anxiety Disorder or GAD that you are already well aware of. This is a chronic, relapsing and debilitating common psychiatric disorder characterized by anxiety and worry about several events and activities for a majority of the day over a 6 months time period. The anxiety and worry associated with GAD can be distinguished from normal anxiety by their excessive nature, the difficulty involved in controlling them, and their interference in everyday life. Having said this I like to emphasize again that it is chronic and relapsing disorder. So if any one needs to discontinue medication it should be done in graded manner. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided at any cost. You might be aware that every medication has its own side effect and risk benefit, analysis need to be done before every single prescription. In response to your question \"Is it true that the effect of these medications become weak or insignificant with time?\" I assure you that with prescribed medication like paxil, the answer is NO. There is no evidence of tolerance with SSRI (Paxil) and wellbutrin. Although such reports you can find in many websites managed by quacks and non medical personnel. I would say it is a MYTH and not a true phenomenon. I hope I have answered your query to a good extent.

If you just want to be sure about the recent infection get an avidity testing for CMV and rubella infection. Your TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is very high. You need to see an endocrinologist or physician for your thyroid. I suggest you start at least 150 mcg of Thyronorm (Thyroxine) daily empty stomach every morning. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicines with their consent. From a pregnancy point of view, your TSH should fall to around 2.4 mcg.

During the general examination this year, I noticed my Hb level around 12 to 13 g/dL. Follow up data in the following months showed 12.7 --> 12.8 --> 12.4 --> 12.6. Normocytic (84), borderline hypochromic (31.5) with borderline Hct (38.5 %) during the last examination. WBC and PLT were both within normal limits and I also had normal differential count with no blast cell. Other lab data like total protein, albumin, ferritin and stool occult blood were all within normal limits. Due to these problems, I looked back for my past examination history and found an examination seven years ago (when I was 18-year- old) showed also Hb level around 12.6 g/dL with similar other lab data. HbEP was also arranged for further survey and revealed Hb A 97.8 % and Hb A2 2.2 %. The reticulocyte count during the last examination showed 1.3 %, which would be bone marrow hypo-proliferative if I corrected it with reticulocyte index. I wonder whether I have some bone marrow problems and seek for bone marrow aspiration. Or, is it just not suitable to use reticulocyte index to calculate reticulocyte when my Hb level was only a little bit below the normal limits? (RBC count = 4570000/microL, absolute reticulocyte count was normal). Can Hb 12 to 13 g/dL be a normal variant in a generally healthy young adult? What other differential diagnosis do I have to keep in mind? Doctor: Hello. You are a medical student, so obviously you are very much alert about health. I have reviewed your query and here is my advise. Your CBC (complete blood count) report is not showing any abnormality except borderline hemoglobin level. You are right in that the male hemoglobin range is within 13 to 17 normally. But, do not worry about your Hb level, it is mildly low. You can take iron-rich foods like red meat, green leafy vegetables, beans, jaggery, etc. Provide me your serum ferritin value to check it. Your reticulocyte count is within range and I do not think you have to worry about hypoproliferative anemia. After taking iron rich foods you can repeat reticulocyte count.

Stop iron supplement for a few days, because you have never seen dark color stool previously. Persistent dark stool despite no iron supplement is abnormal and requires evaluation. 2.

I took an IQ test a few years ago and scored in the 130 range, and since then I have had an extremely inflated ego, to the point of narcissism. I had a severely traumatic series of events in the 6th grade that either made me like this or possibly helped to push it to the surface. I can do nearly anything imaginable and feel no remorse for my actions, lie to anyone without batting an eye, and I also find myself convinced of outlandish things quite frequently. These things may include believing that I can beat anyone in a fight, regardless of size, just because I am who I am and no one will go to the lengths, I will to win. I have stolen hundreds of dollars from a friend before and felt nothing by excitement for my newly found money. I am not scared of what I (think) am, more so just curious. I can provide more details and information if you would like, but I truly just want to know why I am like this. From what I have told you does it seem like I am a sociopath? Doctor: Hello. A very interesting portrayal of yourself, I must say. A sociopath might be a judgement, you definitely have signs of cluster B personality traits, anti-social personality disorder. Such people have these characteristics of apathy, higher sense of self, no remorse, etc. But I have to appreciate you because you do have a lot of insight. I do not know what your goal is by sending this query but if you feel the need, I would suggest having a counseling session so you can understand your subconscious thoughts and be able to respond and not react to your situations. You are 19 now, there is a lot of potential in you if you act now and get a grip on your own mind, otherwise it can harm you and others in many ways. Impulse control, generating empathy, regard for others can be learnt and are necessary to have a good life."

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

Ideally fasting glucose should be less than 100 mg, PP 150 to 170 mg and HbA1c % less than 6.8, in a well-controlled diabetic person. It is clear that present medications are not giving effective control. Following is my suggestion for improving the treatment. There is a need to increase the dosage of Glimepiride to 2 mg with Metformin 500, (to be taken twice a day). To add tablet Vildagliptin 50 mg with 500 mg Metformin to be taken after lunch. Then please check blood glucose (fasting and PP ) after 10 days and report. Increase the intake of green leafy vegetables and salads before taking every meal. Increase the exercise to over one hour a day. If brisk walking is done please increase it to one hour (about 4 to 5 km). For blood pressure, increase Amlodipine to 5 mg per day.

She has a history of high bp, but since two weeks it is normal (120/80 mmHg). On doing an MRI scan, the reports showed right maxillary and bilateral ethmoid sinusitis. Is this sinusitis related to seizures? During the seizures, she gets froth from the mouth and tongue bite. For the first few seconds of seizure, she is conscious, but later she is not able to hear and later on she\u00a0is\u00a0good. Sometimes, she says that she forgot things and is not able to sleep properly. Since\u00a0the past five days, she is snoring during sleep. Does this cause any complication in the\u00a0brain?

Her snoring while sleeping does not produce any complications in her brain. Her memory problems may be predominantly attentional deficits rather than memory loss per se. Regular treatment will keep her seizure-free and there is certainly nothing else to worry about.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Your body clock has been really timed and punctual. Sometimes, due to few reasons like stress, anxiety, hormonal imbalance, strenuous exercise, strict dieting, etc., periods can be delayed. As I mentioned, the hormones affect the periods. As for delaying periods, and induction of menses both, we use hormones only. So, it seems that your body showed some response to your emergency contraceptive pills that are actually hormones. Last month's less bleeding and this month's two days delay are not serious as you are a teenager, and still, your reproductive system is in the developing phase. Have healthy balanced nutritious diet with exercise, yoga, and walking. Try to avoid hormones intake as still your system is developing and can be disturbed.

Whether the copper-T is properly placed or not or to see some other cause for heavy bleeding you need to take a transvaginal ultrasound -TVS.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It mostly was being expelled via my throat with sputum. The cauterized site was yellow and there was yellow pus like all over. I have been prescribed Amoxyclav 625 for seven days, Cefuroxime 500 for seven days. The cauterized site was still not healed and was still having yellow discharge. I then consulted an ENT doctor who took a look at it and gave me Linezolid 600 for 10 days. The infection of the cauterized site is still not healed and still oozing with yellow pus-like discharge although there is slight improvement. I have low grade fever on and off. I feel I may be having an infection in my nose that is resistant to antibiotics. Can you please help me and advice me on how to treat my nasal passage? And also what other investigations should I do? I am worried about the infection whether it could harm me as it continues. Doctor: Hello. The cauterized site you have mentioned might be infected as you said. 1. The best treatement now in this situation is take a sterile swab and touch the swab with the pus and send it for culture and sensitivity, it will definitely give the medication sensitive for your bacteria. 2. Meanwhile start injectables preferably Ceftazidime 1 g and injection Amikacin 500 mg after test doses for five days. 3. Start application of Neosporin ointment on the site."

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods? Doctor: Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I never had a problem with it when I was young, but it probably started when I was 13 years old. I cannot eat out if I go to a restaurant or a fast food place, I feel like throwing up instantly when I sit down with my food. I cannot eat at school and the worst one is when I receive the body of Christ, I almost jump out of my shoes to try and not to throw up. But luckily that never happened.

I think it is not an eating disorder because, in the case of an eating disorder, the problem should be everywhere including your home. However, your problem of eating in public could be because of social anxiety disorder or because of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). So, I would like to seek more clarification regarding the following points: Now, I would like to answer your questions. Yes, this problem of yours can be fixed. Do not worry about that. This could be a social anxiety disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Yes, you will definitely be able to eat outside. You can revert with the answers to the above questions for me to arrive at the diagnosis so that we can decide if you have to meet the doctor in person. I can understand and feel your pain as well.

Let me encourage you to develop a more healthy lifestyle. One practical suggestion would be to join a good gym and have a trainer. You should start with elliptical trainer and treadmill.

I do not want to be misdiagnosed, I have got kids my health and life is depended on. Doctor: Hello. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which an abnormal response of body\u2019s immune system is directed against the nervous system (brain, spinal cord and optic nerves). The immune system of the body mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath the protective coating around the nerves. The cause of MS is still not known, it is believed that several different factors may be involved. Mainly immune-mediated but genetic and some environmental factors have a role. Although some studies have claimed to have a relation between MS and some substances used in paints, etc. But not as spray substance. Otherwise also these studies are not giving a strong scientific basis. These are simple reports that need to be confirmed further before reaching on conclusion. The long contact with some paints can cause neurological symptoms and numbness. But mostly it is reversible. Coming to your problem, you have written I have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. If it is by a competent specialist then I will not comment anything on the diagnosis. What is MRI and CSF results? Anyway, it can only be judged along with physical examination and signs and symptoms. But some of the symptoms are fatigue progressively leading activity limitation, numbness, weakness, walking difficulty, vision problem, urinary problem, bowel problem, cognitive emotional and depressive changes, and respiratory problem if chest muscle gets weakened. As you have apprehension about painting work so the best option for you is to search for some other job even if it is not proved that inhalation of painting is a cause of MS."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods? Doctor: Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am a female of 32 years old.\u00a0I have a\u00a0chronic issue of throat irritation.\u00a0A year ago, I had taken treatment from the ENT specialist. He told me that everything is fine, but some kind of air obstructs the throat. Unfortunately, I lost the prescription. I have been to doctors here, but I am not satisfied. One doctor gave me gastritis medicine and it does not work.\u00a0As per report my throat is fine. I do not have tonsillitis or sinus problem. But, I am keep clearing my throat. My current medication includes Rabeprazole sandoz 20 mg and Motilium 10 mg.\u00a0I am in a real trouble. Please help. Doctor: Hello. We are happy to help you. From the details you have provided regarding your symptoms and the previous consultations, I can conclude with reasonable surety that you are suffering from a condition called reflux laryngitis. This is a chronic condition characterized by symptoms like chronic throat irritation, feeling of something stuck down the throat, frequent clearing of the throat and excessive throat mucous. It is because of local production of acid. Acid is produced in the stomach to aid in digestion. The throat mucosa is not suitable to handle the acid. When such local acid production occurs or the gastric acid contents rise up the esophagus, they cause chronic irritation of mucosa and produce these symptoms. They are seen typically as inflammation of the posterior larynx in endoscopy. If you can search for your endoscopy report and share with us it will be helpful. The treatment for this condition is to take a proton pump inhibitor like Rabeprazole 40 mg or Pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily, half an hour before food for about a month. Also, I advise to take a teaspoon of Mucaine gel (Aluminium hydroxide) after each meal and before bedtime at night for a week. The proton pump inhibitor prevents acid production and the gel which is a combination of antacid and local anesthetic produces relief of symptoms. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. Some additional care to be taken during this treatment are, With these measures your condition will improve. But, it will be a gradual recovery. If you do not recover, then I would like to do some blood investigations to check if there is any other factor that is causing the throat issue. Also a repeat endoscopy can be advised to recheck the larynx, hypopharynx and cervical esophagus for the throat irritation.

I have some mild right upper quadrant pain that\u2019s persevered for a few weeks after stopping all cocodomol use. Over the last year I\u2019ve had abdominal al ultrasounds, many liver function tests and urinalysis which have all come back in n normal ranges or clear. I have been told sometimes the liver can still be damaged but still present normal liver function tests and it can be hard to see on ultrasounds. Is there a chance I have some liver damage? Doctor: Hello. I welcome you to icliniq. First of all I give you a vote of appreciation that you were able to stop using co codamol. For chronic users of these opioid medicines, it is merely impossible to stop. Well once you stopped taking these medicines, it is unlikely that the effect will remain within you and can harm you in long term. So I do not think that you should be worried about this. Now the pain you mention which has started nearly at the time of stop of these medicines; suggest Narocotic bowel syndrome (NBS). In NBS the patient became insensitive to the usual doses of opioids and kept on increasing the doses to relieve the same amount of pain intensity with subsequent higher doses. This happen because of chronic use of these medicines would potentially increase the numbers of receptors controlling pain. Once the medicine is reduced in dose or completely stop (In your case), a rebound pain develop and it remain until another painkiller or similar opioid is restarted. So actually it is vicious cycle. Pain and increased dose cycle is sometime inevitable and requires a close monitoring of switching to other safe painkillers while at the same time decreasing the dose of opioids. The treatment is termed as Opioid detoxification therapy. To be honest, I am not an expert in it, but tried my best to explain d to you to help you understand your symptoms. If you want further guidance on how to control your pain which is possibly be secondary to NBS; I suggest you to meet with pain management specialist in near by hospital. Since you already stopped the medicines, I suggest to use Paracetomol which is rather safe medicine for controlling pain. Plus you can use Cap Pregablin 75 mg at nigh time daily to control your symptoms. I hope this will help you Take care and have a good day. Narcotic bowel syndrome Nothing  Pain assessment only Functional abdominal pain syndrome  Nerve entrapment syndrome NBS Tab Paracetomol which is rather safe medicine for controlling pain.

The blood stopped, but I felt pain, so I went back to the ER. They told me my UTI was gone and to stop taking the medicine. A few days later, I saw blood when I wiped after peeing, but it looks like it was in my discharge. It went on a few times, and I went back to the ER three days ago and said that I was peeing blood again. So, I am worried. I have not gotten my period this month, and no, I am not pregnant.

I cannot tell if it is my period or something else. I have never had this happen before. My mother said that it is spotting but makes no sense to me. Doctor: Hello. This is likely to be irregular shedding which can often occur in adolescence by mid-cycle in girls with secondary progesterone deficiency due to either delayed ovulation or stress-induced hormonal imbalances. You need to get a serum progesterone level done and if it is less than 21ng/dl by day 21 of your cycle, then you may need cyclical progesterone therapy.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

And I do not know if this matters but I do masturbate a lot like at least every day. So what is the likelyhood that she is pregnant? Doctor: Hello. The fact that she had her menses the day before the episode, so the chances of pregnancy are minimal. However, unprotected intercourse can often allow even the precum to cause pregnancy in spite of having ejaculated outside as it is known to contain live active sperms. So the chances of her being pregnant would have been good if she would not have menstruated or if she would have just spotted. The earliest and the best way to rule out pregnancy would be to get a serum beta hCG test done after eight days post intercourse. If the hCG levels are less than 3 mIU then she is surely not pregnant and her bleed is definitely that of her menses. I hope I have answered your query."

Doctor: Hello.  The picture you have attached does not show any lesion (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is a normal looking tonsil showing tonsillar crypt (Crypta magna) which is normal. As of now the tonsils are normal looking.

However it is at times possible that one may be able to express purulent discharge from tonsillar surface even if it is normal looking. Even then there is no need to worry. All you need is a course of antibiotics which you have completed. You only require topical antiseptic mouth gargles like betadine or chlorhexidine. They are not even that hypertrophic to merit tonsillectomy.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, Age : 55 years old. Sex : Male. Height: 5.4 feet. Weight : 70 kg. Initial symptoms noticed before two months: 1. Slight imbalance in walking. 2. Unable to walk properly, unable to control the direction of legs. 3. Needed support of wall (sometimes) or a person. 4. Unable to walk on uneven road. Patient is using Amlokind\u2013H (used for past 8 months for BP). In the initial visits to doctor, unable to find out the problem. Many tests were conducted. All were normal. BP, ear testing, MRI, NRM, Vitamin D, B12 in blood, Hb and sugar in blood normal, BP was slightly increased while hospitalized during tests. Hence BP tablets dose was increased, patient became nervous, lost control on urine and motion. Done more checkups. All were normal. Prescription was used for one month (prescription needed). But no effect was observed. Infact many side effects are observed. Prescription: Ecosprin, Rosucor, Mecorol, Histigo-24 mg. During the above prescription there was no improvement in the health condition, BP tablets were changed by local doctor under regular monitoring of BP levels. Patient condition was improved. Then visited another doctor, prescription changed to Win BP-H 20 for BP tablet. Doctors observation: No strength on right side, (possibility of a semi-stroke) for that Nootropil R- 800 was prescribed. For blood circulation problem\u2013 Deplatt A 75, Rozucor for balance, Vertin 16, Vertizac, Mecoday. When started taking those tablets, patient became nervous on the next day and was unable to move towards bedroom when he woke up for toilet in the early morning. Fell fully on the supporting person and sat on the ground. Then had to visit doctor. Again BP tablet changed again to Olmat-20. Current status: Symptoms similar to initial state (as observed 2 months before). Can walk but slight imbalance was observed. Can work alone but needed supervision. Symptoms aggrevated when lemon was used. Has to avoid lemon and tamarind. Now facing difficulties because of side-effects of tablets (lot of heat unable to talk and eat food properly) 1. What is the root cause of the problem? Solution for the same? Shall we continue or discontinue the current prescription? Is it because of BP tablets or lime? How to make the effect of BP tablets negligible? Doctor: Hi. It appears that the patient is having neurological problem at multiple levels. 1. Causes for imbalance while walking:  - Problem in cerebellum (part of brain), unlikely in this case as the MRI of brain was normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  - Weakness in one part of the body might have happened due to stroke, even then MRI brain should have shown that. - Weakness in both lower limbs due to problems in spinal cord. This is more likely as loss of control over urine and motion can also be seen in spinal cord problems and the test mentioned by you have not evaluated spinal cord problems.  My advice is get one MRI whole spine done and upload me the report.  2. BP tablets will not cause any of these symptoms, so I advise to continue the BP tablets so that BP is maintained less than 140/80.  3. Vertin and Vertizac can be stopped.  4. Stop Deplat- A, Rozucor instead start tablet Ecosprin -AV.  5. Because of taking previous all those tablets he might be having acidity problems which gets exacerbated by any citrus fruits like lemon, so, I advise him to take antacid like Syrup Mucane gel 10 ml 3 times a day before food.  Also, tell me what is the level of power and how is his control over urine and motion revert back with the details and report of MRI whole spine."

The patient is not on antibiotics. Can a high vacuolated neutrophil result indicate some sort of problem other than an infection? Doctor: Hi. I appreciate your knowledge. You are right, vacuolated neutrophils suggest towards infective etiology more likely. But let me know you in such a case usually neutrophilia is also seen. So vacuolated neutrophils interpretation should be done in accordance with total WBC (white blood corpuscles) and total neutrophils count. Your clinical correlation and physical examination are also necessary. Vacuolations in neutrophils suggest phagocytic function of it in infection e.g. pneumonia, fungal infection, septicemia, typhoid, etc. Sometime in inflammation also such cells are seen. As you have rapid weight loss cause for that should be searched. Some of the causes are HIV, acute infection, COPD, gastrointestinal problems like celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, tuberculosis, etc. So the clinical correlation is necessary to do further work up.

The condition is known as nevus sebaceous. In case of deep surgical excision in nevus sebaceous, chances of it coming back are very less. The thing is the excision should be deep to minimize the chances of recurrences. Laser treatments are there but not very effective and chances of recurrences are more.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Avoid dry fruits, cold drinks, and chocolate. 3. Avoid broccoli, spinach, beans, and non-vegetarian diet. I would highly recommend testing uric acid once again after one month to reassess the uric acid value. As a single high value should not be the basis for starting medical treatment. Because the treatment usually has to be continued for a long period. So begin the diet modification from today, and repeat uric acid after a month, and review again for further advice. As a patient with high uric acid has an increasing tendency to form renal calculi, I will also advise sonography of abdomen and pelvis, if already not done, before the surgery. Uric acid, RFT (renal function test), sonography of abdomen and pelvis. Review after one month with the above mentioned test."

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I have anxiety and panic attacks from last six years. My doctor prescribed Nexito Forte 10 mg. My doctor tapered the tablet to Nexito Plus 5 mg three years back. My questions are: Is the relapse due to decreasing the dosage? Should I increase it again? Doctor: Hello. The dose of the particular drug depends upon many reasons. So, it is difficult to tell that this dose is effective or not for the particular person. Now coming back to your questions, first Nexito Plus (Escitalopram and Clonazepam) has only half of the dose compared to Nexito Forte (Escitalopram and Clonazepam). So, when tapering the dose, few persons may relapse. If you develop the symptoms of anxiety, you need to increase the dose again. And it is quite difficult to predict who is going to relapse. Secondly, as the Nexito Plus has a lower dose of the drug, it is quite prudent that it may not be effective in all persons. So, increasing the dose is a good option. Similarly, when one is tapering the dose, some symptoms may reoccur. Then one has to slow down the pace of tapering as to avoid the relapse. So, if you are stable on Nexito Plus, then no need to increase the dose, but if you have symptoms then you need to increase it. The dose is basically changed according to the response and side effects, one is tolerating. It is individually designed to meet the requirements of that particular person. Thanks and regards.

And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

This was 20 years ago, and I have not worked in this field since. While doing this I never wore a mask, no one in the shop did that, except the painter when he was in the booth. No one online seems to wear a mask when doing these tasks either. I know the dust from this process probably is not fantastic, but I had no short term effects and was just hoping someone in the know can put my anxious mind at rest by confirming that the reason no one wears a mask because the dust is relatively safe as far as long term health conditions go. It seems highly unlikely these were fiberglass based as automotive fillers seem to be plastic-based. I also might have been in the shop when sanding of paint happened or smelt the smell of spray paint after a job but never remember being in close proximity to anything like that. Doctor: Hello. There is a health hazard upon exposure of such inhalational dust materials for short term exposure (up to 6 months), it can produce allergic rhinitis, cough, and sputum. On long term exposure, it may produce cough, wheezing, nasal stuffiness, fever, blood in sputum, difficulty in breathing. In your case, the exposure is short term and after that no exposure now. You are away from those exposures. So, if at all the issues were there, that might have been now settled down and you become absolutely normal. Only in long term exposure, lung gets damaged or bad effects continue even after stopping the exposure. So, you are on the safer side. You are normal now. If you wish still to test it, then go for x-ray chest, pulmonary function (breathing) test and differential count in the blood. These will tell still the hazardous effect is there are not. I do not recommend you to go for these tests. I hope this helps."

Is it like a fat mass? Is it under the eyebrow as a small ball and moving when you put your finger on it? If so, it is a chalazion.

You can put it on the lid and inside the eye twice a day for the first week and once a day the next week. Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. If no result, your ophthalmologist will remove it by a minor easy operation.

I have tried to maintain good personal hygiene with daily change of undergarments to no avail. Over time it returns and the patches only get bigger and leaves the skin discolored. I have also been given Fluconazole. Could you please recommend some form of treatment to get rid of it completely? I am currently on Thyronorm and Ciplar-LA 40. Please help. Doctor: Hello. Recurrence of tinea is most commonly due to either incomplete treatment or wrong medication most commonly the combination of a topical steroid with a topical antifungal e.g Candid-B (Beclometasone Topical and Clotrimazole Topical) or other similar preparations. Topical steroids and antifungal combination creams though more effective in providing symptomatic relief from itching, actually prolonging the infection which manifests as clinical recurrence as soon as the treatment is stopped. Therefore, you should use a plain topical antifungal like Lulifin cream (Luliconazole) 1% creamor Onabet cream (Sertaconazole) 2% cream twice daily for five to six weeks rather than using a combination cream that contains a topical steroid and topical antifungal. In addition to this, I also suggest you take a different oral antifungal like tablet Zimig (Terbinafine) 250 mg once a day for five to six weeks. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicine. I also suggest you take an oral antihistamine like Cetirizine 10 mg tablet for symptomatic relief from itching.

As with history, I can speculate that you are having trapezius. As the pain around the shoulder blade is due to the inflammation of the insertion of the trapezius muscles. As per my clinical practice of I do not think that dry needling and massage are the more extended term relief. I will advise that you should do hot water fermentation over the upper back and neck region. Post that, myofascial release, correction of the posture, and strengthening of the trapezius muscles.  This issue is commonly arising due to bad posture and the cervical spine IVDP (intervertebral disc prolapse). But for the cervical spine IVDP we need an MRI to understand the nature of the soft tissue injury. I understand that doing hot water fermentation, myofascial release, correction of posture and trapezius strengthening has helped my patients relief of the pain. I request you to look for one and let us see after a week. I assume things should get correct soon with the mentioned treatment plan.

I went through your query and the attached image (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have two lower second premolars extracted with no third molars in the lower jaw. Little bit crowding is seen in both upper lateral incisors that might be the reason for you opting for braces. Well, as a specialist upper tooths have a little bit of space in between the central incisors. Upper front teeth need proximal slicing to facilitate space that space will be enough to realign your both upper lateral to the arch. Although it is just a front profile if possible upload a side profile of your face to evaluate the overjet but I can say just marginal and proximal slicing of the upper front teeth will be enough, and no further extraction needed. Meanwhile, you have missing both lower second premolars. Get a fixed bridge to cover the gaps or else they will shift and get malaligned. Upper third molar are also fine and does not need extraction in the near future. Go for normal braces instead of Invisalign. Normal braces work much better in these cases.  I hope this helps."

Please suggest. Doctor: Hi. There are many reasons for having loose stools. Even, anxiety cause increased motility, and it results in diarrhea. Coming to a sore throat, it may occur due to a viral cause. You can get tested with fourth generation test as you have already crossed 28 days and the test result will be conclusive for diagnosing HIV. You can continue your treatment.

You can have a gas problem due to functional indigestion. I suggest you take gelusil MPS like syrup before bedtime for one week. It is advisable to take Rabeprazole like antacid for the week also.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My son is 4 years old. I know he is still too young, but when he is not feeling well or he is tired, he gets very deep sleep and he urinates himself- basically, he is bedwetting. Well, I have to admit that I was bedwetting till I was 14 years old, my father also was bedwetting when he was young. I know it is too early to say, but can he have the same problem when I was young and I was bedwetting? My problem was, that time to time I get very deep sleep and I did not respond to signal sent to my brain that my bladder is full. So, I wake up time to time wet. The second question, I see in him the same thing when I was young and also he is bedwetting when he is not well or very tired, he gets deeply sleep, but when he wakes up he is fine. Last time he gets a little bit higher temperature 38. I did not give him any medicine and let him sleep when he wakes up, he was wet, but the temperature was gone and he was fine. So what do you think? Any advice? Doctor: Hi. There is no co-relation between bedwetting and temperature. So do not worry about that. Also as regards to bedwetting, make it a point for the child to empty the bladder before going to bed. Also, you can wake up the child in the middle of the night if you find out that he has bedwetted himself so that this develops a behavioral change in the child and eventually will go a long way in stopping bed wetting. Another technique that can be used is a bedwetting alarm which sounds when the bed becomes wet and wakes the child up. This can also help in reducing the instances of bedwetting. In extreme cases, we use vasopressin to reduce bed wetting. Also, bedwetting beyond the age of 5 years is not acceptable. Hence, follow the above mentioned advise and observe the changes in your child. For more information consult a paediatrician online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/paediatrician"

I am interested in taking Insulin replacing oral medicine. I heard that oral medicines cause weight reduction and dangerous for kidneys. Doctor: Hello. The Metformin component of the oral anti-diabetic medications aids in weight loss and is usually preferred in overweight candidates. But, there are other medications that do not lead to weight loss, so, you can definitely ask your physician to shift you to such medication. Also, just like all medications have side effects, long term studies in patients taking oral anti-diabetic medications, have shown deteriorated kidney function. Many people are not compliant in keeping up with daily injections of Insulin, also the risk of hypoglycemia is higher with insulin. Hence, not many people prefer it. If you feel you can cope up with it, please speak to your local physician or diabetologist. They would make a chart depending on your daily sugar levels, as to how much units of insulin would you require. Also, they would educate you regarding rotation of sites, for taking the insulin injections, how and when to take them. Also, don't forget to ask your physician to explain the symptoms of hypoglycemia and also to tell you, when exactly should you be taking the insulin injections (before food, during food, morning or night basal dose) depending on its duration of action.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore. Doctor: Hello. The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling. Get an X-ray done to find out the exact problem and stronger antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) along with a painkiller for a week.

I did not take the drug every day and after roughly two months I quit the drug altogether, the withdrawal, that I did not recognize at the time, kicked in (Extreme tinnitus, sweating, heart racing, heightened anxiety). I went to ENT doctor and she gave me two Dexamethasone injections in 3 days (I think 8 mg). I developed during these 3 days a major loss of short term and then long term memory, trouble finding words, trouble learning in general. The physical symptoms of the steroids and benzo withdrawal went away in 2 weeks. It has now been a month since I feel physically fine, but the cognitive issues persist and they do not get better at all. I have been to a psychiatrist because I felt overwhelmed that Iam not going to be able to finish school in such a state and she gave me Escitalopram thinking it could be psychological, but there is no improvement in cognition after a months use. Does that combination have that drastic side-effects and could it caused a chemical or structural problem in brain? What can I do to return somewhere close to my old self? I am 24 years old. Doctor: Hi. People taking Alprazolam should not combine it with alcohol and avoid combining it with other medications, such as narcotic pain relievers, that cause drowsiness. Doing so can cause additive drowsiness and reduced breathing as well as other side effects, which can be dangerous and possibly fatal. Alprazolam may be habit-forming when taken for long periods of time. If you have been taking this medication regularly for a long period of time (more than one month), do not stop taking the medication without speaking with your doctor. A gradual reduction in dose is recommended when stopping this medication to avoid withdrawal symptoms.  Escitalopram works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin so that there is an increased level in the brain. Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter responsible for mood and well being. It is usually taken once daily and may take a few weeks to months reach maximum therapeutic potential. So continue taking Escitalopram until you see significant improvements in your memory."

You have correctly described your floaters. Only thing is that it is perfectly normal as they are part of aging and will only increase with time. They develop as the vitreous jelly inside our eyes liquifies with time. So they move when your eye moves. They do not cause blindness on their own. They are a matter of concern only when there is a sudden shower of floaters associated with flashes. In that case, you will need an examination of your retina after full dilation of your pupil to rule out any break in your retina which if not lasered on time may proceed to retinal detachment.

Doctor: Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. The first-trimester ultrasound scans done before 12 weeks are the most accurate ones in the assessment of gestational age with an error of only + /- 5 to 7 days in the assessment of gestational age. So they are used for obstetric dating and determination of expected date of delivery. Moreover, if you have done 6 ultrasounds and the date calculated from each of them corroborates and does not lag behind then probably your baby is growing well and it is not small as you apprehend. The date we calculate from the first day of last periods is accurate only if the periods were regular for the last 3 months and there was no history of miscarriage or ovulatory disorder like PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) or contraceptive pill intake. In case of any discrepancy the date from dating scan at 6 weeks are accurate and to be considered. It is a probability that you actually conceived in later part of the cycle which leads to this discrepancy between the date and USG."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

What routine medical examinations apart from MMSE and history would you conduct? By this I mean standard routine blood investigations plus other investigations. What clinical signs would suggest performing MRI scan and would you order it with every patient? What clinical signs would suggest performing thyroid hormone tests? Would you do the thyroid hormone test with every patient admitted to the ward? Would it be a standard psychiatric procedure? What neurological and physical examinations would you conduct to rule out any other medical or neurological disorders? Schizophrenia is a dysfunction of brain\u2019s physiology; the functioning through neurotransmitters and through hormones but actually genetic problem is always there; means there is a dysfunction at cellular level. Which neurotransmitters and hormones would be responsible for this dysfunction? What kind of dysfunction of cellular level is that? What does an elevated level of homocysteine found in schizophrenic patients tell the psychiatrist? Doctor: Hi. I have read your queries and shall answer accordingly.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My wife is 36-year-old with a height of 5.6 and weight 69.1 kg. She had NT or NB scan and double marker test in obstetrical ultrasound. The nuchal thickness is 1.0 mm. Presence of nasal bone. DV flow is normal, but in double marker test, free beta hCG is 46.20 and PAPP-A is 2.58. Trisomy 21 -screen positive cut off 1: 250. Mother's cut off free beta hCG is greater than or equal to 1.98 PAPP-A. Doctor: Hello. 1 in 250 means that if we take 250 women of the same results as your wife had then only one will have a baby with Down syndrome. So this is the explanation of the calculated risk of down syndrome. Secondly, NT (nuchal translucency) and blood tests which she underwent are screening tests. Screening tests are not diagnostic. They only detect who is at risk. If they become positive, that does not mean that particular is at risk. It just says that specific condition may or may not be there which is then confirmed by diagnostic tests. In your case, CVS (chorionic villus sampling, taking a sample from the baby) will diagnose if the Down syndrome is there or not which you will be offered at 12 to 13 weeks most probably. I hope it has helped you. If you require any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact me."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

So to put him to sleep follow these steps. 1. Wake him up at morning 7 AM. 2. Do not allow the baby to take more than two naps per day. Each nap should be less than two hours. 3. Avoid all screens and gadgets. Screen time should be less than half an hour. 4. Give him a warm bath at night before going to bed. 5. Rocking motion that is cradle helps to make baby sleep better. Put him in the cradle. 6. Usually, babies wake up at night due to short sleep. You can make routine by putting him to sleep without picking him up. You can give the bottle once or twice during nights. 7. Engage the baby in physical activities in the morning like making baby crawl or creep. 8. Light should be dim at night and you have to make him see early morning sunlight because it resets clock in the body. 9. First try all this. If it does not help then I will prescribe a hormone.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am suffering from tooth decay of my third molar. Should I go for extraction? Or is there any way to save my tooth? Doctor: Hello. I understand your concern and I have studied your x-ray. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The tooth is divided into the crown part and the root part. The tooth structure till the bone level from top is called the crown and beyond that is root. More than one half of the crown part is decayed and the decay had started penetrating the root part too. If you notice the x-ray, you could see the infection penetrated the root and weakened the adjacent bone too (the gap between the root and bone on the left side of x-ray). The infection has engulfed one of the roots completely. The ideal treatment for this tooth is removal i.e. extraction. If the same scenario occurred in a tooth other than the wisdom tooth i.e. the third molar, I would have definitely advised you to save the tooth. The reasons for advising extraction: The wisdom tooth is highly unstable and there are more chances of secondary infection even after a good root canal treatment. It carries out less than 5% of chewing. Extracting it will not make much difference to your chewing efficiency. Oral hygiene maintanance in the wisdom tooth area is highly challenging which caused your decay in the first place (our brush does not reach that far). Any treatment like fillings and root canal treatment in wisdom tooth may lead to jaw issues in the future because of its unstable nature. I hope this helps."

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

According to your statement, you have been suffering from hypothyroidism for the last seven years and your current medication is Levothyroxine 75 micrograms daily, but last Friday you took double dose of Levothyroxine that was 150 micrograms and felt nervous with increased heart beat and joint pain. At first let me ensure you that taking an extra dose of Levothyroxine by accident is unlikely to harm you. You get side effects such as rapid heart beat, chest pain, sweating, nervousness, etc. They may not develop at once, it may be several days before they come on. These side effects that are resulted from over dose will be subside over time and basically no treatment is needed. Normal range for TSH level is 0.4-4 mU/L.so your recent TSH level is within normal limit. As your last year TSH level was 0.55 mU/L and recent result is 2.6 mU/L which is within the normal limit, so continue your current dose of Levothyroxine. No dose adjustment is needed. Now you are suffering from weight gain, puffy eyes, hair loss, etc., if these are resulted from the side effects of Levothyroxine then they will be subsided soon. Please monitor your blood pressure and do investigations like with CBC (complete blood count), RBS (random blood sugar), and S.creatinine level to exclude other causes."

Doctor: Hello.  I can understand you had a terrible time due to this problem since yesterday. The gas production in bowel is a normal phenomenon and majorly produces on its own given the number of gas forming bacteria within human gut; however, there are certain foods and environmental triggers that can increase the gas production.  Foods containing cereals grains such as wheat, corn, maze, barley, oats, millets, and milk. Cauliflower and many others that even you can find out yourself. So your symptoms and just an overnight onset with worsening intensity suggest you probably have one of these gas producing food a day before yesterday.

Tablet Digestine 40 mg once daily before meals, you can increase the dose to twice daily before meals if you dont feel improvement in next 48 hours.

I have started with Aceclofenac 100 mg twice a day, one week ago, as per doctor\u00b4s advice, although he mentioned that it was not standard practice for chronic cases.  Doctor: Hi. Your shoulder MRI (attachment removed to protect patient identity) is not showing any serious concerns but there are some areas which might be causing mild pain and discomfort during movements. In the coronal images, there is likely early degenerative changes in the distal supraspinatus tendon which shows mild thinning of the muscle tendon. There is slightly decreased fat between the acromion and supraspinatus tendon and it can cause mild pain and discomfort with lifting the arm.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I am a 33 years old female, and I have had three c-sections and normal regular periods. My menstrual cycle three months back was short and lighter, and I ovulated about a week early. I noticed some pain, which almost reminded me of implantation pain. This continued on and off with pain and twinges. I thought maybe I was in early stages of pregnancy. Then I started having pelvic pain and lower left ovary area pain, which continued throughout the week. When I would push to have a bowel movement it hurts. I really thought I was pregnant. The fullness and achiness reminded me of early pregnancy. My most recent period was three days late. I went in and saw my OB yesterday. He did an exam and a transvaginal ultrasound, and he said everything looked fine. He tried to recreate the pain by touching some spots. Ever since then, my ovary pain on the left has been through the roof. What is going on? I am terrified I have ovarian cancer. Would he have been able to tell yesterday? What else could be going on? It hurts right around the ovary area and in the groin crease area. Doctor: Hi. After undergoing three cesarean sections, it is quite possible to have intra-abdominal adhesions. Which may give rise to intermittent pain associated with the bowel movements. Hope your bowel habits are regular and you do not have a problem of sticky stools. As there are multiple organs inside an abdomen, other causes of such pain should be ruled out. Hope this advice helps you. Take care and get back to me in need.

Advice: Hot saline gargle before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Stop fried things, it enhances the problem. Are you hypertensive? Check out your blood pressure also. Treatment: Tablet Azithromycin 500 mg once every day for three to six days, Nexpro RD 200 mg one before breakfast and dinner, Esmoprezole plus sustained released Domperidon for three days one before breakfast for five days or whenever required. For irregular bowel habits, take one bowl of salad in the morning and evening. Add curd in lunch. Take buttermilk in the afternoon it is very good for health. Take husk Isabgol three teaspoons full at night with milk. It is a herbal remedy good for the intestine also. It forms a slimy layer and protects the mucosa of the intestine.

But, when his father went away, he again started drinking. We want to know what these reports indicate. Doctor: Hello. I went through your post and investigation (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The person in question has transaminitis (raised liver enzymes) which means there is some minimal necrosis of liver cells on a daily basis which in long run over a period of 10 to 15 years may cause significant liver damage and result cirrhosis. So one needs to start taking care today. He should go for a fibroscan of the liver to see at what stage the liver is. He has to stop alcohol and do some amount of daily exercise.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

Sometimes, later he started to cough and spit blood with the sputum. We took him to the hospital and after the test of endoscopy, the doctors said that my father had cirrhosis. Then he never used alcohol.  Now he takes regular medicines and checkup. Later after a few months, when he coughed the color of the sputum was dark red. Again some blood was coming with the sputum. The doctors said that it was not because of the cirrhosis. But, now his weight gain and belly fat is also increasing. And nowadays, he coughs more. Can you please tell me some tips to take care of his health. Doctor: Hi. First of all, when he had coughed before, and he was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, that is because of gastric varices which he might had developed, and now as you were saying that doctor has said he does not have blood due to cirrhosis, that means he has developed some other pathology. For proper diet plan and his treatment, first I would suggest that you should do one ultrasound of liver that is called fibroscan, get it done and send me the reports. Secondly, you need to get his endoscopy done again and one digital chest X-ray. Once these reports are done, send it to me all the reports along with your query. You must stop all oily food, must keep checking his sugar levels. He should not develop diabetes and if he will then stop his sugar intake, give him more soups and boiled food items only, always avoid raw food like salads and stuff. For cough, you can give him tablet CCGO one tablet twice a day for five days. The tablets can be increased more once I get proper reports to study. Do not worry and take care."

Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects.

The BUN was less than 3, ionized calcium was 1.11 and low creatinine. I am freaking out as no one went over the results with me. I have had four cases of SVT recently, and I am now really worried about these test results. Doctor: Hello. Firstly, low BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine levels are not a matter of worry. Normal BUN range is from 2.5 to 7.1 mmol/L. Also, ionized calcium is a bit lower but still normal. Anion gap is high, but it has got significance if you have acidosis as well low pH. If you read it on a printed ABG (arterial blood gas) or VBG (venous blood gas) report, then it is inaccurate most of the times. Also, creatinine and BUN report on the printed report are rarely accurate. So, nobody usually pays attention to that. And if the clinical scenario is suspicious, then assays are done and anion gap is calculated manually. Next, regarding SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), it is probably not related to your above reports. It is arrhythmias caused by extra pathways in the heart. They are rarely life threatening but cause symptoms. There are two options as follows. It is better if you can upload ECG showing SVT, so as to know what type of SVT it is.

Can you please let me know the diet for food or something else, please. Doctor: Hello. I have reviewed your query and here is my advise. You have been bitten by a dog, so tetanus toxoid and rabies vaccine can be taken for that to prevent tetanus and rabies. But as you said if you are sure that dog is fully immunized with rabies then no need to take the vaccine. No dietary restriction needed. You can eat everything. If a wound is present because of the dog bite then it should be kept clean by a regular dressing.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I am writing about my mother who died 22 days back at the age of 76. For nearly ten years, she suffered from bronchiectasis and was treated with Cortisone. Five years back, because of a general illness (insomnia, tremors and loss of appetite) we went to a few specialists such as dietician and homeopathy doctor. After several failures, he prescribed the Levobren that my mother took in the dose of 15 drops per day. My mother took the drug continuously for a year and a half. After six months from beginning, she could not move the fingers of her right hand and this paresis gradually extended to the arm. In addition to this, she spent most of the day sleeping and she was in a state of mental confusion with low emotional and impulse control. After a geriatric hospitalization last year, it was denied that she suffered from Alzheimer's and was recommended a neurological examination. The neurologist, seeing that she was taking the Levobren from three years, was alarmed and suspended it. My mother was hospitalized in the neurology department where she was diagnosed of motor neuron disease. We decided to start a course of physiotherapy which initially seemed to give results, but then the paresis started to extend from the arm to the right leg, while the left part had no problem. Last month, due to a general illness, loss of swallowing reflex and aphonia she could not maintain an upright position and to presumed aspiration pneumonia, she was hospitalized and she died. Taking into account that by specialist examinations made after the first neurological examination no one has ever confirmed the motor neuron disease, and no one knew how to cure her since she was not included in the protocol of no diagnosis. I would wonder if all this could be caused from taking that drug. I am still clueless as to why my mother died? Doctor: Hi. Sorry to hear about your mother.

The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore. Doctor: Hello. The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling. Get an X-ray done to find out the exact problem and stronger antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) along with a painkiller for a week.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods? Doctor: Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My husband has a problem with pinhead sperms. Is there any treatment in Ayurveda? Please suggest. Doctor: Hello. The pinhead is due to the absence of the DNA material within the spermatozoa (sperm). Thus, a higher number of pinhead sperm are not favorable for conception. Only one healthy sperm is going to reach the ovum, to get a baby. So, even with less healthy sperm, conception is possible. Both husband and wife should be equally healthy enough to get conception. For your husband, traditionally, we give gold, Ashwagandha, and zinc-based polyherbal drugs. At the same time, you also can consume aloe vera based drugs. So, I advise the following for your husband. 1) Capsule Rathina purush one in the morning and one in the evening. Continue till pregnancy get success.  2) In diet, he can take pure cow milk, cashew nuts, sprouted green gram, groundnut, other edible seeds, and drumstick as a vegetable.  3) He should avoid tea, coffee, smoking, chicken, alcohol, and packed foods, fruit juices and soft drinks strictly. All these damages the sperm.  4) Should not wear tight jeans pants. Should not get exposed to continuous heat and radiation sources, these things will reduce sperm quality.  5) Weekly once apply sesame oil to the whole body and head. Wait for one hour and then take a bath in warm water.  6) Daily before bed, take normal water (not cool or not hot, it should be in medium level) or mild-warm water in a tub. Sit in this water by dipping buttocks and genitals within this water. Sit for half an hour. Then come out. My advice to you: Tablet aloes compound two tablets in the morning and two in evening after food. Continue this tablet until you get pregnant, stop in between during menstrual days. Note: a) I hope you had done all the tests for infertility to you and your husband. If any varicocele in testis or hydrocele, that is to be corrected.  b) For you, the ovulation, endometrial thickness are important.  c) There are a lot of healthy couples with normal lab report, without a successful pregnancy. So, I would say that the baby is nature's gift and that you get when the couples have positive thinkings (positiveness in life and mind). So, please keep your mind positive with hope."

What type of headache is this? I know taking so many pills is not good. Please advice. Doctor: Hello. If you would have presented to me as an outpatient, I would have advised you to do mental relaxation exercises, yoga, and meditation. If I am asked to make a clinical diagnosis on the basis of medical history, I would say tension-type headache (TTH) without any doubt. Headache at the back of the head with associated neck pain, inability to put the head down and difficulty in getting sleep all are very classical for TTH. Meditation and yoga will definitely help if it is TTH. Regarding drug therapy, my advice is to stop all the current medications you are taking and start taking tablet Tryptomer (Amitriptyline) 25 mg half tablet for initial two days and then full tablet daily while going to sleep in the night.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have gone through the pictures of your old records (attachment removed to protect patient identity). By your description, I understand you have some idea about your condition. It looks like irregular astigmatism. This might have developed due to weakening of cornea, which is common after radial keratotomy (RK). This causes distortion of the image like irregular lens.

Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

In order to prevent UTI keep your perineal area clean like cleaning after intercourse and daily cleaning of the area during bathing. For the cure, you will need an antibiotic for a week. First, you should get urine routine and microscopy test done to confirm the infection. You should also get an ultrasound done to confirm cystitis and rule out other causes of bleeding.

So now continue Folic acid 5 mg daily and do have scans at 13 weeks for nuchal translucency at 20 weeks for fetal detailed anomaly scan and at 22 weeks for cardiac outflow tract to be on safe side. Do not get stressed. Metronidazole is not contraindicated in pregnancy and Nystatin can be used locally."

CT scan with contrast was clear. I was given an antibiotic (Augmentin). But there is no relief. Doctor: Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your CT (computed tomography) scan is clear. Below Adam's apple, there is a thyroid gland, and a nodule in the thyroid is quite common. But the rest of the features suggests infectious mononucleosis. You need to do blood tests to rule out the disease. The lump is required to be examined in person for a proper assessment. But a loss of appetite and fatigue may favor a thyroid disease or infectious mononucleosis. You can take antiviral drugs like Valacyclovir and steroids like Wysolone to get relief from symptoms. But I recommend you get the diagnosis confirmed first. It is also called as kissing disease as it spreads through close contact. Take the medicines mentioned above.

Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you. Doctor: Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

This condition is mostly common in male sex and more in hairy people. I will ask you a few questions and your co-operation will be invaluable. What is your profession? Do you have to drive for long hours and what is the duration of the swelling? This is very important because this condition is common in drivers. The hair from back or above natal cleft breaks penetrates through the skin causing cyst and it can get infected and cause a pilonidal sinus with serous or pus discharge. Surgery is the treatment. Now I will answer the queries one by one. There is no risk for the surgery as such if you have diabetes, the sugars have to be controlled. You have to make sure that you trim the hair over the anal region as I have already mentioned that it is common in hairy males. So if you do not trim your hair near the anal region it can recur. You should get X-ray sacral region to rule out osteomyelitis. Success rate 70 to 80 % depending on the size. You have to be in the hospital for 3 to 4 days. You can work normally after 7 to 10 days. You have to keep your anal region clean to avoid infection."

Within past 12 hours, I am experiencing lots of pain typical of when I am to pass a stone. However, the stone has not passed. Also, noticing blood in urine for the first time. I have passed urine about four times within the hour. I am aware that this is part of the symptoms but want to know if I should see a doctor immediately. Any other advice appreciated. Doctor: Hi. I hope the bladder stones you mentioned you had earlier had passed. Blood in urine after renal colic suggests stone may have reached the lower end of kidney tube (ureter) and may pass soon. However, it is best to confirm it has passed by getting an ultrasound done. Flomax (Tamsulosin) helps dilate lower end of the ureter and so may help stone to pass. You may take painkiller or antispasmodic for pain. Increased fluid intake helps. If the stone is of pure uric acid, taking citrus juices or taking potassium citrate syrup may dissolve the stone. I suggest, if bleeding continues, or there is pain or fever, or you have difficulty emptying your bladder, go see your doctor. Later, a metabolic workup of your 24-hour urine collection may be needed to see why you form so many stones.

Erythromycin is a hepatic enzyme inhibitor meaning it will delay the metabolism of Lucette (Ethinylestradiol and Drospirenone) thus allowing increased levels of the hormone in the bloodstream for a longer duration than normal. Hence the effect of contraception will not be hampered but the side effects of the pill may be more apparent, including acne breakouts.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My daughter aged 9 years has been suffering from allergic rhinitis for the last few years. During the winter season, cold and cough are very common for her. In the summer, she suffers from coughing and itching in the body. The problem is hereditary as my whole family members like my mother, brother and sister are suffering from it. Due to this reason, I regularly give her one Montek LC tablet (Montelukast and Levocetirizine). Now I consulted with an ayurvedic doctor and he advised me to give her turmeric formula (organic turmeric rhizome, turmeric extract, ginger rhizome) and immunity (organic katuki rhizome with root, Krishna tulsi leaf, Vana tulsi leaf). Can I give her these herbal and organic capsules? Are they safe and can be continued with Montek LC tablet? Doctor: Hello. I just read your query and saw the prescription of allopathic as well as an Ayurvedic physician. First of all, let me answer your question. You can give these Ayurvedic treatments to your daughter along with her allopathic medicine. It does not have any side effect and will not cause any problem to your daughter. So you can continue this. See, the tablet Montek LC (Montelukast and Levocetirizine) is an anti-allergic medicine and stop the histamines from releasing in the body. Histamines are responsible for allergy. So it is the main treatment for this problem. But one thing you can do along with this tablet that increases her body's natural defense mechanism is you can give her syrup Septilin (Tinospora, Shankha Bhasma, Maharasnadi Kwath) one teaspoon two times a day with lukewarm water during the change of season for one to two months. You can consult your Ayurvedic physician regarding this if you want to. Also, tell her to do simple breathing exercises daily. It will help her a lot. Take Desi ghee (clarified butter) made of cow's milk and put two drops of it in the lukewarm state in each nostril daily for one to two months. It will also help her in relieving symptoms. Try these things and you will feel positive results. You can consult your Ayurvedic physician regarding all these if you want to.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am a 31 year old male. I am 6 feet 2 inches tall and obese at 113 kg. The problem that I am describing below I have been experiencing for the past 10 days or so. I have a more or less constant headache. It is typically on the right part of the forehead, around the hairline and occurring at the center of my head. The pain is not very severe. It is not throbbing or pounding, though the intensity fluctuates at times, it is never very severe. I also experience a vague sensation of nausea, but no vomiting tendency. Sometimes, I get a subtle feeling of dizziness or light-headedness. I am unable to describe it more precisely. It particularly occurs during the head movement. This occurs hardly for a millisecond or so. Also, my eyes feel strained at times while staring at the computer or TV screen About my past health history, I have sinusitis. This was detected two years ago. I had visited an ENT specialist for a throat irritation, for which he got me to do a CT scan of my entire head and neck area. I have not had any treatment for sinusitis except some medication for the first week or so after detection. However, I have not really felt a similar headache earlier. I also tend\u00a0to catch a\u00a0cold very easily. On several days, I wake up sneezing which resolves on its own as the day progresses or within a couple of days. In the past week also, I had experienced the same few times. I also developed eye styes on both eyes which were painful and watery. I wear spectacles. The power is (\u2013) 5.25. However, I do not experience blurry or double vision at present. I do not feel any difficulty or loss of balance while walking. I have a habit of walking, and even three days ago, I had walked non-stop for 4 km in about 45 mins but did not experience any difficulty or anything unusual during and after the walking.\u00a0About a month ago, I had been experiencing for few days a strange stiffness in my lower left leg after walking a small distance, a non-specific back pain, and a vague breathing difficulty. My GP advised me to get a chest X-ray, PFT, echocardiography, and ECG done. All the reports were normal. The problems since then have significantly reduced. I am forgetful by nature. Apart from that, I have not noted any memory loss as such. I have no unusual difficulty in concentrating or thinking clearly. I do not experience any speech problem, but I did notice on one occasion that after speaking continuously for few minutes, I was facing some difficulty in speaking more, but that I believe could have been due to psychological reasons. Exactly five months ago, I had got a CT scan of the brain done on the advice of my GP because I had a severe headache one night few days after accidentally bumping my head on a solid low-height door. However, the results were normal, and nothing was found. Uric acid, blood sugar, creatinine, and TSH have been tested within the past eight months, and the reports were normal. However, lipid profile tests revealed high triglycerides (292) for which I took Rosumac 5 for three months, after which the triglycerides (152) were relatively normal. I have had high BP (140/100) for which I was prescribed Aquazide 12.5, which I am taking. One week ago, I got my BP rechecked, and it was found fairly normal (130/80). I tried steam inhalation yesterday and the day before, but it did not resolve. What could be the possible cause for the headache\u00a0and the other issues described in the first paragraph? Could this be something serious like a brain tumor? What are the chances of it being any such thing, given that I had a CT scan of the brain only five months ago and everything was normal then? Sorry for the lengthy post. Kindly help. Doctor: Hello. A headache can be due to many causes. Few common causes are: In your case, it seems to be either due to the aggravation of sinusitis due to a recent weather change or raised blood pressure. Sinusitis leads to constant secretions within the sinus leading to a headache and nausea. The treatment for sinusitis will definitely improve it. For sinusitis, you can take antibiotics, analgesics, and anti-allergics after a consultation with an ENT specialist. Also, your blood pressure target should be 120/80. Since your CT head is normal, there is no chance of development of brain tumor so quickly. A brain tumor will lead to a constant headache and also other pressure-related symptoms. Thanks.

Hill-Sachs injury is a bony defect and you may need investigation and arthroscopy. You may need arthroscopic repair for bony Bankart lesion. Take rest for early healing.

However, these are not causing me significant stress and my BP has not shot up this much before. I get fevers on and off\u00a0and take Paracetamol for them. Just before this started, I was feeling extremely depressed and took eight 25 mg Phenergan tablets with two Co-dydramol tablets (500 mg/10 mg).

I was not prescribed to have\u00a0Phenergan, so I understand that I should not be using it, but I did. Since then I have just been taking two or so at night every three days roughly. Two days after I took the load, I was having horrible acid reflux and burning pain. When I talk to a doctor on the phone, he suggested that my thoughts of it being a stomach or peptic ulcer may have been correct.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco).

After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, My mother, who\u00a0is 55 years old, is undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer T4 M1 (less than 5 mm non-avid in lymph node above lung) Nx, after mastectomy. She is HER2 positive and other two receptors are also positive. We have two different opinions in front of us from the two best oncologists here. The first opinion from our current oncologist is FAC 3 cycles (already given), Daxotel (3 cycles and second one is going on) and then to continue with Herceptin. The second opinion from another senior oncologist is that since she is HER2 is positive, the above regimen of the FAC and Daxotel is useless. She needs to start chemotherapy all over again with 6 cycles of Abraxane along with Herceptin. Otherwise, metastatic cells will spread soon to brain.\u00a0The second opinion hit us and gave a big shock. She has just finished the task of chemotherapy and we hear that the drugs used were useless.\u00a0I am here to know the reality of above and to seek an advice of which route we should take. Please help us. Doctor: Hi. I understand your plight. Your mother seems to be in stage 4 and less likely 3. However, to give the benefit of doubt, I think that people has considered to give chemotherapy followed by response evaluation. If the result is favorable, then they may even opt for surgery (variable). In stage 4 hormone positive, we prefer to give the only antihormonal agent. In her case, anti HER2 therapy has to be added as she is positive for it. I will not suggest the second type of chemotherapy at this time if there is no obvious progression. In my opinion you should continue with third dose and see the response on radio imaging. We may plan to continue anti HER2 with hormonal agents, while keeping her on close follow up. In less often scenario, if the response is phenomenal, then we may plan surgery. But, this will need further discussion. Do not worry, she should do well.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,My 39-year-old son was hospitalized for five days with serotonin syndrome. He was given intravenous and Ativan. He was discharged from the hospital and he will go to his doctor regarding his meds. The problem is he was never told if he needs to stay away from certain foods that might cause his serotonin levels to elevate. I was just reading online about foods to avoid with serotonin syndrome and after reading this I am not sure what he can eat. Sadly, the hospital did not give him any information on what he could eat. There is a list of foods that increase serotonin levels which include foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as tuna, and those high in tryptophan,\u00a0an amino acid found in eggs, soy and soy beverages, turkey, eggs, pumpkin seeds, peanuts and peanut butter, chicken and cheeses. A diet rich in folate may also contribute to increased serotonin levels. Some foods rich in folate include leafy green vegetables, beans, legumes, nuts, bread, and cereals. It sounds like there really is nothing he can eat without worrying about causing any additional problems. After reading all this, what can he eat? This is extremely scary as I have no clue about what he can and cannot eat. If possible, please reply as soon as possible because I did not realize that all these foods were included in things he might have to stay away from, other then turkey perhaps. Thanking you in advance for any advice. Doctor: Hello. Hope I answered your questions. Take care.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I am 35 weeks pregnant. By last week my stretch marks were started to itch.\u00a0So, my OG advised applying Calamine lotion (which does not contain antihistamine). It seemed to soothe the itching, but slowly the itching started spreading to my upper arms and thighs. Then she prescribed Avil tablet for two days and told to apply Caladryl lotion (which contains antihistamine) only on the itchy areas of my arms and thighs. It seemed to relieve the itch temporarily only. Once the effect of the lotion and tablet is off, I became itchy again. Finally, the OG prescribed Udihep 150 mg to be taken twice daily in the morning and night, suspecting it to be obstetric cholestasis. She also advised to take Avil tablet at night and to apply Calamine and Caladryl to soothe the itchy areas. I am on this regimen for the past four days, and the itch seems to have subsided a bit, but not completely. I am also taking calcium supplements (Ostonate 250 mg twice a day), Astymin forte (vitamin supplement once a day), Fol 123 (at night) and Iron supplements (Orofer XT 100 mg two tablets at night). I have been on increased Iron supplements from the last four weeks because my hemoglobin dropped to 9 last month. Now it has improved to 10.5, but my doctor told to continue taking the prescribed two Iron supplements as only one month is left for delivery. My concern is will there be an interaction between the Udihep and the supplements I am taking? Or is there a possible chance that increased iron intake during the last month would\u00a0have caused an additional stress on my liver leading to cholestasis? Kindly advise. I am attaching my hemoglobin blood test and urine routine reports. Doctor: Hi. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Let me start by putting you at ease by saying that you are normal and your doctor has been doing a great job. As you are near delivery, the skin stretches to its maximum and the tissue under the skin will start giving way. You will have stretch marks, but they will be further increasing, getting pinkish or redness. This itch will subside only after delivery when the stretch of the baby is relieved. Another possibility is due to obstetric cholestasis. But this has been ruled out by the blood tests, so just relax and the danger has been eliminated. This cholestasis is due to the effect of progesterone hormone on the liver, leading to high levels of the liver byproducts. To relieve itching the medications are right, and they do not have any significant interaction. You can further reduce the itching by applying some local irritants like balms or onions juice. These will cause burning sensation, which will mask the itching. About iron and hemoglobin, during the second trimester, every lady's hemoglobin will drop a bit as this is the time baby's blood volume suddenly expands. So, all iron and vitamins will be taken from your body. By last trimester the hemoglobin will improve on its own, as baby's blood is already ready. These iron tablets will be absorbed from intestine and excess will not be taken in at all. As a result, your stools will be blacker. To improve your hemoglobin, health and baby's health in the last trimester, have a lot of water, proteins, vitamins and sugar. These will also give you the energy needed for delivery. The right amount of sugar (unless you already have diabetes) will make baby chubbier and healthier. Somehow hold that itching till the 37th week, then delivery is the solution. There is no other solution. For more information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/obstetrician-and-gynaecologist"

Doctor: Hi. I went through your photograph and found that you are suffering from nodular cystic acne with scarring. It is a severe type of acne. Acne is common at a young age. It occurs due to blockage and inflammation of sebaceous glands under the influence of androgen hormone. They also occur due to cosmetics. Diet has a little role and generally, they subside in mid-twenties. They need treatment to avoid scarring which may be permanent. If you have increased hair growth and menses irregularity you have to rule out PCOD (polycystic ovary disease). You can take capsule Isotretinoin 20 mg once daily with meals for four weeks, Clindamycin gel twice daily over the pimples, Salicylic acid face wash once daily, only for 30seconds, and tablet Azithromycin 500 mg once daily on empty stomach for one week and three on consecutive days per week for three weeks. If you want to use sunscreen. Review after four weeks. Scarring or pores left after healing can be treated surgically by needling, microderma abrasion, or by laser only after remission. Hormonal. Lipid profile if history of cholesterol disorder in the family. Acne nodulocystic. For three to four months as per the response. Do not touch the face too often. Do not use oil or greasy cream over the face or scalp. Take ample amount of fluids. If there is intolerant dryness with this, use Petrolatum or Vaseline on lips.

The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Is it okay to continue this? Doctor: Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

Is there something I should worry about? Doctor: Hello. The arteriovenous nicking or AV crossing changes you mentioned, although present, seem quite harmless in the fundus photos you have sent me. Please do not worry about these, as they are not associated with other precursor changes of hypertensive retinopathy. I am also happy with the fact that your blood pressure and heart tests are normal. This matter of AV nicking would need nothing but periodic monitoring per se, probably once a year. I also have a responsibility as a doctor to tell you that in the photos that you have attached, the disc is asymmetric.

Inside of this green circle is the dark circular optic disc and inside the optic disc is a grey or white color optic cup.

Exhaustion typically increases the severity of the jerks. I have had the problem once, two years ago, when I took an antihistamine for allergy. Doctor: Hello. Myoclonic jerks can have various reasons including epilepsy, liver disease, kidney disease, neurological disorder or sometimes they can be idiopathic. At your age, epilepsy seems to be relevant, though not confirmed, without an evaluation. Do you get jerks in your upper limbs too or vocal tics?  You will have to get evaluated clinically by a neurologist who might ask you to undergo certain tests. With that, the exact trigger which causes your jerks can be found. Most of the times a simple pill, prescribed after a thorough examination by a neurologist, can make your symptoms go away. Just make sure you do not self-medicate.

If I take cold foods, I will have running nose throughout the day and severe sneezing. Also I have itching and watering of eyes. Currently, I am taking homeopathy treatment. When I have severe sneezing, I use Allegra 125 mg. Please tell a solution to get cured of this. Doctor: Hi. My diagnosis of your condition based on the information you have provided is allergic rhinitis. However, to confirm the same I want you to do two investigations namely serum IgE and absolute eosinophil count. Both are blood investigations. Allergy is not curable, however you can control it. You can keep it under wraps so that you are not bothered by the frequently disturbing symptoms. It needs patience and perseverance from your side. Following are some precautions and suggestions to help you deal with this problem. If we know for sure that you are suffering from allergy (positive results in those two tests which I told you) we can institute you on steroid nasal sprays namely Mometasone Furoate (Metaspray) or Fluticasone Propionate (Flomist). These will reduce local inflammation in the nose and prevent allergic symptoms like running nose tremendously. However, they have to be used continuously for a period of one or two months. They are safe and do not produce side effects like systemic steroids. I am unsure regarding homeo medicines whether it will be helpful for this condition or not. You are advised to use your discretion regarding the use of homeo medicines. However ayurveda medicines being entirely natural (as what is claimed by manufacturers and ayurveda pharmacies) can be combined with allopathic medicines without fear of side effects. 1. Dust, dust mite, smoke, pollution, wind, pollen, saw dust, husk, agricultural dust and industrial air. 2. Food allergies like prawns, peanuts, milk and gluten. 1. Serum IgE. 2. Absolute eosinophil count. 3. Total blood count. 1. Allergic rhinitis. 2. Non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome. Allergic rhinitis. When you suffer from allergy (on the day of intense sneezing and running nose) take a tablet of Allegra (Fexofenadine) 120 mg. If the problem appears daily then take Montair Fx (combination of Montelukast sodium and Fexofenadine hydrochloride) for three nights daily.

I am currently on Naproxen, Co-codamol (when required due to back and neck pain resulting from a car accident) Fluoxetine (daily). Doctor: Hello, Welcome to icliniq.om. We all are at risk to COVID19, but regular washing, sanitization of hands and use of masks outside the home can reduce the risk. Since you have encountered pneumonia earlier, your defense system must be boosted up. Still, I would recommend that you talk to your physician and get yourself vaccinated with: 1. Influenza (Quadrivalent) vaccine yearly. 2. Pneumococcal vaccine every sixth year. These vaccines provide good prophylaxis against typical bacterial and viral infections."

Keloids are a type of scars which itches or irritates when something touches it.

Whether this drug is available without doctor's prescription? Thank you. Doctor: Hello. First, please confirm the pregnancy with a serum beta-hCG test (human chorionic gonadotropin) as urine pregnancy test is not reliable till eight days post missed periods. If the hCG levels are more than 5 ng/dL then she is pregnant. In that case as she has been a post C-section case, medical abortion is not to be undertaken with either Mifepristone or Misoprostol simply. Because, the C-section scar would still be weak by one year and there are often chances of uterus rupture. The best option in that case would be an ultrasound guided dilation and curettage procedure for surgical abortion. Please meet your gynecologist and get the needful.

I can understand it must be really hard for you to be in this situation. What you are describing looks like an anxiety disorder. There is nervousness in starting anything new because the mind has negative thoughts which overwhelm you and make you feel it might not work out, and then the mind gets fixated on this pattern of negativity and you just cannot stop the overthinking which gives you stress. And long term stress produces aggression. What you need is to start psychotherapy. Via counseling (psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy) the therapist helps you find out where these thoughts are coming from and help you in changing these thoughts in and controlling them so that inside it is not produced in the first place. Second part is anger management where you learn some techniques to control your temper and also via therapy you will be able to find out the source of your anger. I would need to talk to you in detail to be able to find out why you are having these thoughts after I take a detailed psychiatry history and evaluation. You can find a local therapist or we can start therapy sessions online via video consultation.

Cardiologist usually looks at the ECG and patient's symptoms. If the ECG does not show any features of conduction abnormalities and the patient is fit, healthy and has no symptoms, then it is reassuring especially if they are athletes. However, if the ECG shows a conduction abnormality or delays then it is of a concern and if the patient has symptoms of lightheadedness, fainting, collapses or exertional breathlessness, then it is of concern and needs more investigations and possible pacemakers if the condition persists after stopping all heart slowing medications. You need to bear in mind that a single ECG could confirm a conduction abnormality if present, but does not 100 % exclude as the condition could be intermittent, This is why a period of continuous cardiac monitoring is recommended for the patients who have symptoms could be related to conduction abnormalities."

The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I am a 33-year-old obese male. About 1 and a half years ago, I had a painful folliculitis, right below the left nipple which was cured after taking some antibiotics. It had caused a tiny bump below the left nipple, which when touched hurt. Anyways, after taking antibiotics it got healed. The place, however, continued to have a bump, but it was hollow to touch. You could press it down and when released, it would pop back up again. There was no pain. About three weeks ago, I felt pain in the exact same spot where I had folliculitis and sure enough, it was back. It was painful to touch exactly like when I first got that. So I took antibiotics and the folliculitis got cured again, in the sense that there is no longer any pain to touch it. However, the bump of the folliculitis still remains. It does not pain at all to touch no matter how hard you touch it, and the size of the bump has also lessened. However, that bump remains and feel hard underneath, though it does not hurt to touch. What should I do? Doctor: Hi. The description you have mentioned is quite classical for anetoderma. This condition arises whenever the skin's elastic and collagen fibers are damaged because of an infective or inflammatory condition. Due to the painful folliculitis, a few of these fibers in the affected area could have been damaged resulting in such condition. This can occur as a consequence of any skin disorder, it is totally benign, and if not causing any trouble best to leave it alone. However, in case you want to try something for it, you could use Tretinoin 0.025 % cream over the affected area for two hours daily."

I was diagnosed to have diabetes. I consulted my friend with is a doctor and under his guidance, I changed my diet and started the exercise. I reduced my weight from 103 kg to 91.2 kg. After three months, my fasting was 117 and PP 153 with HbA1c 6.5. My lipid profile is normal. For the past one week, when I check my glucose level in glucometer at home, it is less than 110. I am not in diabetes medicine. I think I have ED. What are the test that needs to be done to diagnose the same? Doctor: Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. First of all, I like to inform you that there is no test which alone can tell you whether you have ED (erectile dysfunction) or not other than the history and proper physical examination. This is the thing which are done by the doctor when you present yourself in his or her office. Based on the observation doctor decides whether the testes are required or not. In case required he only decides what are the tests required based on the available history details and clinical examination. I mean to say that you need to see a properly trained sexologist to determine the number of tests required. This is because the presence of abnormal test does not mean the test abnormality is the cause of the problem and similarly, the presence of normal test result does not rule out the problem. However, in routine practice, we order normal biochemistry (blood sugar, GTT - glucose tolerance test, HbA1c, lipid profile, LFT - liver function test, and thyroid profile), hormonal profile (free and total testosterone, prolactin, LH - luteinizing hormone, and FSH - follicle-stimulating hormone), USG abdomen and pelvis, and penile Doppler study among others. These are often a minimal requirement and the number of tests can change as per the need of the individual patients. I hope this helps you. Feel free to write back to me if you have more questions."

Eight months later, I had a PCR RNA qualitative and another fourth-generation blood test antigen and antibody, both were negative. I also got tested for Hepatitis C, HTLV I and II. But signs of lipodystrophy are present, fat relocation to the abdomen. Legs are thinning. Low testosterone, lipid abnormalities as well. Elevated sedimentation rate and CRP come and go as well. I really think this is HIV but if it does not show up on a test I cannot get treatment. Or if this is not HIV what else should I get tested for? Doctor: Hi. As per description, you are more obsessed with HIV rather than the actual scenario. Any infection will have a remnant in the body, called the footprint of the infection. In case of HIV, the virus leaves its particles in the body, of which p24 is the core protein that protects HIV DNA. For HIV to infect human CD4 cells, it needs to break this core protein and release RNA material from the virus which passes to human cells and then further replication continues and the virus spreads through the body. So, we test for p24 particles in the body. If they are present, then you are infected and if it is not present, then you are not infected in any case (even you highly suspect or think). So, the fourth generation detects, not just these particles but also the body's response to these particles, called p24 antibodies. So, if you are negative after three months by this test, then there is no chance of being positive with the exposure. You have to accept the truth. And coming to other conditions, lipodystrophy, check for the endocrine problem which may be a cause of low testosterone. All your complaints may have undiagnosed conditions but HIV is not at all the cause. Do not be obsessive, accept the truth that you are free of infection."

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

The crown feels sensitive when I touch it. So I am afraid there is an infection underneath it. My dentist is closed for the weekend. Nothing I do stops the pain. My regular doctor said she would need an X-ray to confirm an infection. Doctor: Hi. I understand this would be a very painful condition. If it has started with pain so hard inside the crown then infection has definitely occurred. In such cases, re-treatment is done with a very poor prognosis or tooth extraction is done that rules out the cause of infection with 100 % prognosis rate. Things to do right now include taking Ibuprofen 600 mg TDS (thrice a day, that is, eight hourly for three days). Start saline water mouthrinses 4 to 5 times a day. (Take a cup of lukewarm water and add 1/4th teaspoon of salt in it and do its rinses). Do not lay down straight. It will trigger up a toothache. Keep pillows a bit high or some more cushions under your neck while trying to sleep. If only painkiller Ibuprofen does not help much with pain in a day, then you must start with this antibiotic regime as soon as possible. Tablet Augmentin 625 mg BD (twice a day), tablet Gramex (generic: Metronidazole) 400 mg (twice a day), tablet Ibuprofen 600 mg (thrice a day). That is the best regime to be followed in tooth infections provided that you are not allergic to any of such medicines. Hopefully, it will help."

Im aware that my medication has proven to have negative effects on my sexual libido, but my real concern is why there is such a difference in my sexual experiences when with my partner versus myself. Thank you ! Doctor: Hello, Feeling satisfied in intercourse depends on a number of factors - Sexual desire (spontaneous sexual interest including sexual thoughts, erotic fantasies, and daydreams.etc.). Psychological issues. Relationship issues. Another important point is that during masturbation you are aware of the pleasure points in your body and can therefore attain maximum pleasure, while with a partner a lot of other factors are involved. Also, maybe you should consider using another drug instead of Zoloft 50? Sexual desire is typically more psychological and situational in women, influenced by how they feel about their bodies as well as the quality of relationship with their partner. I suggest you talk with your partner so that you can experiment with different techniques. Also to find what suits you and your partner best so that both of you can understand each other better sexually. (Many women do not experience desire until after they are genitally aroused, and arousal may require an extended period of foreplay)"

I am not very clear about what you have asked in the question that you need treatment for the last disc. Is that a prolapsed disc or disc bulge? Here are a few suggestions to reduce your low back pain. 1. Maintain a proper posture while sitting, make sure that your back and head and aligned in a straight line while you sit down and also while riding any vehicle. 2. Sleeping supine, i.e. with your lying down with your back parallel to the floor and you facing upwards on a firm mattress is known to reduce the pain. 3. Avoid lifting heavy weights until the pain subsides. 4. Stretching exercises of the back and legs are known to help in the reduction of back pain. 5. Warm compresses, i.e. using a cloth that is dipped in warm water or a water bag (pain relief bag) will give some relief. 6. Tablet Paracetamol 500 mg three times a day with eight hours gap for five days may be tried. 7. Diclofenac gel can be applied two times a day over the site of pain. 8. If the pain is very severe or if it is increasing in severity in spite of the above measures, it may be a good idea to visit an orthopedic doctor for a complete evaluation. I hope this helps."

Wellbutrin XL ( Bupropion XL) can be increased to 300 mg XL once daily in the morning after you have been taking Wellbutrin XL for at least four days. The dose has to be increased gradually to minimize the risk of side effects like seizures. If Wellbutrin XL 300 mg is not available in the pharmacy, you can potentially take two doses of Wellbutrin XL 150 mg, taken together as once daily in the morning (giving you an effective dose of 300 mg once daily). Both pills should be swallowed as a whole and not crushed or chewed. You can switch to Wellbutrin XL 300 mg once it becomes available. Another easier option will be to try generic Bupropion XL 300 mg tablets as they contain the same active ingredient. I note that you mentioned you do not like it. Is it the medication effect or taste which is not to your liking? If you feel strongly against the generic version, you can take Wellbutrin XL preparation itself. Whichever option you choose, kindly discuss with your prescribing doctor as some pharmacies will not dispense unless the preparation and dosage are clearly mentioned in the prescription.

Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning.

For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

I do not think there is anything to worry about. Running for a longer time, say for few months at least, will make the heart stronger and decrease the heart rate, not for a week. There are numerous factors which can affect our heart beat like exercise status, walking before taking heart rate, psychological status like anxiety, etc. So, this can cause an elevated heart rate. I guess you do not have any symptoms like dizziness, shortness of breath with elevated heart rate, right? Also, no harm in getting a thyroid test done as resting heart was on the lower side.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It can be managed by two approaches - first, behavioral therapy and second, drug therapy. Behavioral therapy includes squeeze technique, start-stop technique, and coitus interruption technique. You can read about these online and practice any one of them. It takes time to effectively practice them. So, keep practicing. Second, a drug from SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) group is used for premature ejaculation as the side effects of this class of drugs are delayed ejaculation, which is used here. Usually recommended drugs are Fluoxetine 20 daily or Paroxetine 12.5 mg daily or Dapoxetine 30 mg one hour prior to sexual activity. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take medications with their consent. Behavioral therapy has benefits of long-term effects.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

In head injury, an observation period of 24 hours is essential, and if there is no progress of symptoms, then there is almost no probability of any serious problem. 3. If you get any symptoms like headache, dizziness, vomiting, visual problems, then it requires an evaluation and CT scan head. If there are no symptoms, then you are alright.

His penis was on my vaginal part but was not inserted and neither did he ejaculate there, and then I had my periods 15 days after the previous one. I read that implantation bleeding also occurs like the period and is hard to distinguish. My period lasted for 5 to 6 days, and the bleeding was normal. What can be this? Was it a normal period? Doctor: Hi. As you have described your history that irregular periods are already there. You are a teenager as well could have some irregularities in cycles as the phase of development but continuous irregular cycles need to be investigated actually. Strict diet, strenuous exercise, hormonal imbalance, illness, medications, contraceptives all can delay periods actually. For pregnancy, a single sperm can help to conceive otherwise in case of hormonal imbalance women used to take medications, extra health precautions for years to conceive. So it is luck as well. For safe side, you can have serum beta hCG (blood pregnancy test) to check your pregnancy status. If it comes negative, then you can have combined oral contraceptive pills cyclically for three months to aid your menstrual imbalance. In case of a negative test of serum beta hCG, you can have a transvaginal scan and on day two periods can have blood tests (serum progesterone, testosterone, insulin, thyroid function test, prolactin), collect all results and can discuss here or with your local gynecologist as per your convenience. Blood pregnancy test will completely guide you correctly.

You appear to be suffering from Haglund deformity, which is otherwise called Achillestendo insertional tendonitis. It happens from overuse and consists of inflammation and swelling of the Achilles insertion. It is not related to your ankle injury earlier. Treatment usually is pain killers, anti-inflammatory, cold compresses, stretching exercises and sometimes use of a small heel in your shoe to relax. Your ankle pain is possibly due to arthritis resulting from the injury. The treatment depends on the age and the severity of the injury. If you are having pain in the front of the ankle, first you need to get an x-ray to study your ankle. Further treatment depends on the radiological findings and the severity of arthritis.

The boil burst by itself though and now I have three boils in my eyelid and the third one is in the inner corner of my eye. Is this serious? Doctor: Hi. Your history indicates recurrent inflammatory swellings of the glands of the eyelids in the form of hordeolum/stye (focal infection of the glands of the eyelid). Since these swellings are recurrent and multiple, you require evaluation to treat the underlying predisposing factors. However, no need to worry as this is not a serious condition. The treatment for hordeolum is the use of antibiotic eye drops or eye ointments and anti-inflammatory drugs. Applying hot compression provides symptomatic relief. The common problems that need to be ruled out are refractive errors, blepharitis (chronic inflammation of the eyelid) and systemic conditions like diabetes.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

This is called post-coital bleeding especially occurring in form of darkish brown mucoid secretion mixed discharge or often in form of spotting and usually accompanied with pain. The most common cause of such complaints is usually cervical erosions or cervicitis which can be confirmed after a per speculum examination and a pap smear by your gynecologist. This is usually due to a frictional lesion of the cervix during intercourse and a repeat friction causes fresh bleed each time increasing inflammation. The treatment is usually a 10 days course of antibiotics with complete abstinence from intercourse for three weeks and a repeat PAP smear after a month to evaluate the recovery. Other possible cause could be a cervical polyp, a cervical growth or often vaginal dryness secondary to chronic vaginitis-causing vaginal abrasions and bleeding.

After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

My recent medical checkup indicated that I have BP which is marginally little higher than regular and doctors indicated that it is not that much to be concerned about.

There is no scratch on the upper part, no problem in urine passing or bleeding but still paining. What can this be? Doctor: Hi. Since there is no external injury as well as internal injury (normal passage of urine) I feel the problem is with muscle damage rather than anything. The simple muscle injury can be dealt with analgesics such as Ibuprofen 400 to 800 mg to be taken two to three times a day. Also, over the next three to four days there is a good chance of recovery from damage, and there is little to worry about it. It is also essential to maintain proper lubrication, and hard penis should not be rubbed over a hard surface as it is risky and may cause more damage.

My skin will stretch more than normal, hypermobility of my joints due to fragile stretchy tendons and ligaments that provide poor support. I have very dry eyes and so, I am using ointment at night and gel lubricant by day. I was previously on Restasis for a year. I have had no eye surgeries or other trauma that I can think of as it might cause symblepharon. Is that a fixed condition of attachment? Or can it be manually detached (by the patient) and then reattach again after another night of sleep? It is very odd and appears a bit like mucus in photos, but it is not mucus at all. I have this sort of superfluous white tissue that adheres over my eye during sleep. I can gradually and carefully detach it from the eyeball in the morning using hot steam compresses. It seems to spring back to wherever it came from. The eye is very red and irritated with a throbbing ache similar to after getting poked in the eye. There is also usually some residual swelling afterward in the hollow between the top of my upper eyelid and the eye socket. This phenomenon occurs only with my left eye, which has mild ptosis since I had some mini-stroke episodes about 5 years ago. It is affecting my vision and now I have some pain basically all the time on the surface of this eye and it is also painful with eye movement. I am currently taking Naproxen for inflammation and joint pain and Tramadol when needed for migraine pain. The migraines are left hemisphere and affect the same eye.

This appliance, which, you are using now, modifies your palate and it helps to erase some orthodontic problems.

Firstly, your Hb is borderline, and MCV and MCH are low which is suggestive of iron deficiency. So, you should once get your iron profile test done to look for iron deficiency. And if needed, iron supplements later. Also, increase intake of iron-rich food like green leafy vegetables, dates, jaggery, etc. Next is, your BMI (body mass index) falls in the overweight category, which leads to slight derangement of SGPT and slightly high BP. Also, this is the reason for your slightly deranged lipid profile. So, a healthy lifestyle and weight loss are necessary. You should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high-calorie diet. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly thrice a day for one week, then once or twice a week. If BP is persistently more than 140/90 mmHg, then you should be on medicines for it. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according to your capacity at least 30 minutes a day and five days a week. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, avoid meat. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. Next, your eosinophils count is slightly elevated. Do you have any allergies, etc.?

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I am 31 weeks and two days pregnant. I had an ultrasound at 20 weeks, and everything was normal. However, with time, I noticed there was little or no movement, and the baby's movement was more like a ball rolling in a difficult position. So, my doctor sent me for an ultrasound at the thirtieth week. The scan showed severe oligohydramnios and intrauterine growth restriction. My due date was brought forward by a month. On the twenty-fifth\u00a0week, the baby's weight was 603 g. I have tried rehydration and bed rest. Can you offer more help? Doctor: Hi. Let me put forth few facts about pregnancy and baby growth. The growth of the baby is progressive, but if it stops at some stage, that amount of growth cannot be regained. Some reason has been missed by the doctor during the pregnancy monitoring. There could be many causes like uncontrolled diabetes, severe thyrotoxicosis, inadequate food intake or severe vomiting, or a condition called APLA (antiphospholipid antibodies) syndrome (here the baby is rejected by mother's body gradually, as it is a foreign body). So blood flow gradually reduces, as the blood flow to baby's kidney reduces, baby's urine output reduces and thus oligohydramnios becomes severe. In the same way, the baby has to be monitored with scans every week or more often depending on the scan report, fluid level, and doppler scan changes. We cannot take the baby out very early because it will die of immaturity. We can give the mother Steroid prophylaxis at around 28 weeks, to improve baby's lung maturity and to prevent hemorrhage in the baby. Once any of the findings are abnormal, the baby has to be immediately delivered. All we can do is wait and monitor. At least in the next pregnancy, such problems should be anticipated.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I am a 38 year old male, and I have been feeling twitches in my arm. I started feeling this constant twitch about six weeks ago. I did not experience any weakness in that arm or anywhere else in the body. The twitches lasted for about a week and then went away. The twitches have now appeared four weeks later in the same area (upper arm). Again, there is no apparent weakness, which I have tested by lifting weights at the gym and both my upper and lower body strength seems to be fine. What is worrying me to death is, could these twitches be an early sign of ALS? Is it possible that weakness will follow even though I do not have it now? Do ALS twitches go away for four weeks at a time and reappear? If I started to experience constant twitches six weeks ago, if this was ALS should not I have experienced some weakness by now? Is the fact that the twitches are localized to the same place a bad thing? Doctor: Hello. I have read your query and understand your concerns. First of all, I will suggest you consider other possibilities before jumping to conclusions. There are a number of conditions which can present with twitches without any disease, and ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is one of the remotest possibility for a 38 year old young male. The commonest cause for twitches is simple worry or anxiety. I know at least 100 individuals with anxiety, who presented with simple twitches and no other symptoms. In my opinion, you need to see whether these twitches have any relationship with your anxiety level. The another common conditions which present with twitches is endocrine abnormalities, such as thyroid and parathyroid disorders. In case the stress level is not able to explain the twitches, an evaluation for endocrine abnormality is indicated. The list may go on in a similar fashion.

It suggests that there is something is going on inside body, but it does not localize the problem. Any infection, inflammation or low hemoglobin can cause raised ESR.

The person is 30 now and said that the problem was there from his childhood. All of the siblings have this tremor in the hand and finger. If the men or women from the affected family marry the person outside the family, then does it come to the child? Is this type of tremor curable? Women in the family are not able to hold the lid of the pressure cooker and cut vegetables. Men in the family are not able to hold the tea cup that means hands are shaking and not able to dial a number in a mobile phone without shaking. They underwent test before 10 years and was diagnosed to have essential tremor. Now, I want to know the answers to the following questions. What is the further impact and symptoms of essential tremor over a period of time if left untreated? How does it affect the daily activities? Is it genetically transferable to the next generation?\u00a0Do we have any permanent cure for essential tremor?\u00a0If the person has essential tremor, then what are the chances of linkage to other illnesses and disorders? Doctor: Hi. I have read your question with care and understand your doubts regarding essential tremors.  If not treated, the person will not be able to do or will do with much difficulty works involving fingers like writing, mixing food, button shirts, etc. Activities which require co-ordinated movements of the fingers will be affected. Essential tremors can be due to various reasons and a few of these reasons are transmitted genetically. A few are acquired. Even among the ones which are transmitted genetically, it can be AD, AR, XD, XR that is autosomal dominant, autosomal resistant, X-linked dominant and X-linked resistant respectively. So, unless we know the exact cause of this tremor, we cannot answer about genetic transmission. Without knowing the exact cause, the answer for this question is 0 to 100 (0 for acquired and 100 for AD). The cure of essential tremor depends on the cause. A few causes can be cured completely, a few causes can be controlled and a few cannot be cured at all. Again, the link with other illness and disorders depends on the cause of the tremor. Coming to this particular patient, who has this when going to new places or during anxiety, this tremors can be controlled with proper medication. You have to consult a neurosurgeon who has had experience in successfully treating such patients for physical evaluation.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

It can be brought down into the arch with surgical exposure and braces. However, there are certain risks with such teeth. Somtimes the tooth is joint with bone compounded by the bend in the bone and so does not respond to the pressure. In such a case, it will have to be extracted. This happens in extremely less number of cases. So it is a risk worth taking for the canine tooth since it is a very important tooth. Younger the patient, better chances."

I already have a temporary filling which as fallen out and the hole seems to be too big. Please advice. Doctor: Hello. Use warm saline gargling daily at least 2 or 3 times, for two weeks. This will help in reducing the inflammation and help in preventing further recession of gum line. Also if you can get Betadine gargle for rinsing then it would be much better, this would be of great help in case of severe periodontitis (gum inflammation and receding gums). Use sensodyne toothbrush (as suggested by your treating dentist) which have very soft bristles in an upward and downward motion only. Do not scrub the toothbrush over gingiva (gums) as it may cause further recession of the gum line. If the recession is severe then it may require flap surgery, still, the receded gingiva can never be brought back but a further recession can be avoided. You need to get that filling done as early as possible or it may result in infection of the tooth root. The receding gums might be due to: 1. Faulty brushing habit. 2. Calculus deposition. 3. Poor oral hygiene. Intraoral x-ray of the affected area. Use of saline gargle, betadine gargle, flap surgery and antibiotics if required. Follow proper brushing technique with soft toothbrush."

But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods? Doctor: Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I want to clear my skin up, so it does not look all bump and scard. Doctor: Hello. You have a case of pseudofolliculitis barbae, although a term reserved for male beard condition, you got it because of tampering and ill hair removing practices. Treatment includes manual correction of ingrown hair (visit your dermatologist) under magnification. Your hairs have changed their direction due to pulling. Once pulled out, they will grow normally and will not cause redness and bumps within the skin. Go for laser hair removal, which will take care of both hair growth as well as ingrown hair. Make sure it is a laser and not an IPL (intense pulse light) device. Things can be normal if you start following the right path. I hope this answers your query."

I have gone through your case in detail (attachment removed to protect patient identity). In my opinion, your daughter got some insect bite reaction as in pictures all pinpoint boils are in curved fashion as most commonly seen when any bug or insect crawl bite on skin. It has some peculiar foot prints. Hydrocortisone is considered a good cream in such type of reactions as it controls itching. But sometimes it exacerbates infection while it controls burning. I would recommend you to mix Hydrocortisone cream with Fucidin cream (Fusidic acid) in an equal amount and apply twice daily for seven days. Do not use any cream alone. Give antiallergy syrup like Cetirizine half teaspoon once at night. No specific test is usually required in such cases."

In the meantime try to apply an ice pack on your nose with your face in an upward direction and buy nasal spray Oxymetazoline it will help with your situation.

His birth weight was 1.26 kg. Due to his preterm birth, the\u00a0baby was in NICU for 45 days and got discharged. During birth, he had RDS and a surfactant was given and later supported with CPAP for five days. Feeding was done with OG tube and slowly shifted to oral feed after 25 days (spoon feeds). Initially, he had feed intolerance, but he is fine now. NN jaundice was diagnosed and phototherapy was given. At discharge advice, weight: 1.89 kg,\u00a0height: 45 cm, HC: 30 cm, breastfeed on demand, spoon feed every 2 hours. Medications: Caffeine 9 mg (now stopped),\u00a0multivitamin drops (D3 and A to Z), Domstal suspension 0.5 ml, iron supplement 0.4 ml.As of today, he is 65 days old and his weight is 2.42 kg. In the last 24 hours, he is passing more liquid stools and not like a paste. His usual pattern is one to three stools per day. But, in the last 24 hours, he pooped at least 10 times and most are a bit watery. He is exclusively breastfed. No formula is being given. Is it a sign of loose motion? If so, what should be done? During his stay at the\u00a0hospital, he caught a\u00a0mild cold. His\u00a0doctor gave him nasal saline drops and we are using it. It has been almost three weeks now and the baby is slightly coughing. One week back his pediatrician\u00a0told no medication needs to be given and it will go away. He makes a lot of noise while sleeping. How to treat this cold and cough in a preterm baby? Will this lead to any other complication? His feeding is a challenge. He likes breastfeed, but sucks only for three to four minutes and falls asleep. If we try to wake him up, he is not active to take the further feed and within the next 30 to 40 minutes, he will wake up and demand feed. Due to this frequent feed, my wife gets really tired. Spoon feed he is taking but that too not as expected. He is passing urine well. My concern is whether he will drink enough milk when put on the breast? What should be the pattern to follow? He frequently makes a lot of grunting noises. We are much worried and doubt if it is because of any pain or discomfort. Are these sounds and moves normal? Doctor: Hello.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am addressing this query to you regarding a long battle with bloating and constipation. Before proceeding, I would like to emphasize that this is very important to me as I have undergone several tests and I have been advised to consult a dietician or nutritionist to follow up my symptoms. I am doing this as in my country there are few, if any, nutritionists and dieticians. The only doubts that came out of previous examinations with gastroenterologist are IBS subtype C suspect. The bloating is the most frustrating thing that I have battled recently, even more than the anxiety disorder which I had a couple of years ago. I am active in gym and it has not made a lot of difference to my bloating issues in the past.  My blood examinations are totally fine with a slight elevation of cholesterol at 6.2. I am on Venlafaxine and have no other medications that I take. So lets jump to the question. I have recently undergone a wellbeing examination in a clinic, with the help of a follicle sample from my hair. I received the results, and found some pretty interesting feedback. It appears that I am intolerant to the following: \u03b2-Lactoglobulin at 87%, Chamomile tea at 91%, Earl grey tea at 92%, E211 (benzoic acid), E403 (alginate ammonium alginate) at 94%, E479 at 90%, E903 at 96%, Soya bean at 95%, Mango 100%, White sugar 97%, Berries at 84%, Rye at 98%, Olive oil at 96%, Indian saffron at 96%.  As a recommendation from the report from the clinic, I have been suggested a regime of 90 days of not eating for the following: Salmon, Berries, Cow Milk, Prawns, Mango, Potato, Cod, Clams.  I have also been recommended to increase the intake of K2 and D3 vitamin, as well as arachidonic acid and oleic acid. There is also a suggestion that I should increase the intake of amino acids like alanine, carnitine, phenylalanine and taurine. Finally it is recommended that I decrease the resistance of bacteria and fungi with different sources of food. For your information, I would like to mention that my body is very selective towards high fiber foods. Some of which, for example avocado, make my bloating worse and cause a very bad flatulence for hours.  After this lengthy description I would like to know what kind of diet should I follow? What do you recommend I should strictly take out of my diet? I have an addiction to chocolate. Is dark chocolate included in that list of ingredients or potentially harmful? Are cheese, yoghurt and other dairy products harmful as well? How about fruits and red wine? Are they also prone to bloating in my case? My word, I should be allowed to eat something for the sake of my soul. I would plead to whoever is at the end of this query to please come up with some recommendations on a specific list of foods based on the evidence above, as my bloating has made my life so frustrating. It is making my mood absolutely miserable. Doctor: Hi. First, you shoud avoid chocolate, too much dairy product, and red wine. Take cereals, fruits, tender vegetables. You should take yogurt among dairy product. You can take roti, toasted bread, rice, oats, cornflakes, cereal product. Take apple, banana, pear, sweet grapes or fruits whatever you liked but taking after any meal. Take plenty of water. Sleep atleast 7 to 8 hours. Do meditation regularly. Avoid alcohol, spicy, oily, fast food. Take soaked fenugreek seed water in empty stomach at early morning."

My throat does not hurt or itch anymore but I am more bothered by the chest pain now. The inner pain started before just below my breast on the right, but now it is nearly on the chest itself but still on the right. Please advise. Doctor: Hello. The most probable cause for the chest pain, in the setting of the problems described by you, is due to muscle spasm on account of indiscriminate coughing when the infection was present. Now the phlegm is less, signifying decreased infection or healing. What you need are some muscle relaxants and pain killers. Couple this with some balm application locally followed by steam and hot fomentation. Take adequate rest. This shall pass, nothing to worry.

A swollen nipple as well as tender breasts can occur if you are just before your cycle. If so, it is quite normal. It is due to the temporary hormonal fluctuation inside you. Otherwise, taking hormonal contraceptive pills could be a reason. Hard sex with rough handling of your breasts is another issue.

You can stop it a week before like if you want to have periods around 14th of the month, stop tablets on 8th.

Doctor: Hello, Welcome to the icliniq.com. The middle ear infection can be possible according to the mentioned history. You need to get your otoscopy ear examination first to rule out any pathology in the ear if present. If the infection is present in the form of redness and pus in the ear during otoscopy examination, then medication is given accordingly oral as well ear drops. If impacted wax is present than wax loosening drops can be prescribed, meanwhile for the pain you can be prescribed Brufen like medications. I hope I have answered your question.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am a 22-year-old woman who is struggling with extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, tire easy or poor endurance, treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, panic disorder, skin picking issues, sensory processing disorder and ADHD. I have been a strict vegetarian for 12 years now and for a lot of that time, my diet was poor and mostly carbohydrate based. I have suspected an iron deficiency for a very long time. I had a test for it a few years ago and my hemoglobin was normal but my ferritin was only 39. My doctor said it was fine. I recently had a terrible experience with several methods of birth control and for a few months was having 10 day periods twice a month, and at its worst, I was bleeding for a month straight. I started taking a food-based iron for 2 to 3 months (27 mg) and had my iron checked twice within six months. Both times my ferritin was up to around 80. However, I still feel increasingly tired and other conditions are being ruled out. I just realized that before both of those tests with normal results, I had taken an iron pill within two days of the test. My question is could that have given me a false reading on the ferritin test? If I would have had iron the day before? Is a couple months of food based on iron enough to have raised my levels that fast? And lastly, given the heavy bleeding and relative lack of dietary iron in my life, how could I not be iron deficient? Currently, I am taking Clonazepam PRN, Lamictal 50 mg. Doctor: Hello. Ferritin is an acute phase reactant. This means that apart from reflecting iron stores, it also reflects the inflammatory condition in the body. Taking Iron supplements just a few days before the blood test is not sufficient to raise your serum ferritin levels so quickly. But if there is any inflammation going on in your body, your serum ferritin levels will be raised. It is thus very important to rule out any inflammatory condition before interpretation of serum ferritin levels. Have you checked your vitamin D and vitamin B12 levels?  Deficiency in vitamin B12 & Vitamin D can also produce fatigue, weakness and neural disorders. You should get your blood levels of these two vitamins checked and continue taking your Iron and Folic acid supplements. I would suggest that you take the regular Iron and Folic acid supplements available in the form of pills along with a glass of orange juice or lemon water for better absorption.

You should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty oily spicy food. Avoid heavy meals, inspite have multiple small meals. Do not immediately sit or rest after meals, but have a walk for 10 to 15 minutes. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. Also, the sleep pattern should be normal as much as possible.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary.

But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I am very worried. I maintain good hygiene. Kindly help. Doctor: Hello. I went through the details you have provided and feel it be an allergic condition of skin known as pompholyx. Pompholyx generally causes itching of the hands and feet. Since these body parts directly come in contact with external objects on a day to day basis. The substances that aggravate this condition are pollen, chemicals in detergents, paints, solvents and rubber materials. When you have an allergy, it is advisable that you stay away from the allergens. There are chances of blisters to be infected. Hence, do not puncture them. To control itching, I would suggest you to start taking tablet Cetirizine. Based on the severity, you may need oral and topical steroids. Kindly consult a dermatologist for a prescription to the above. Skin irritation that is caused when you are out in sunlight might be because of rosacea or can also be a cause of sensitivity to a particular wavelength. For this, I would advise you to start using a sunscreen with an SPF30 (sun protection factor) regularly. You may also need oral anti-oxidants and photoprotective medications that are prescription based. Avoid taking hot beverages and spicy foods."

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

      "src": "Patient: Dear Doctor, All my life (since as far back as I can remember in early childhood) I have struggled with chronic insomnia. I have tried every sorts of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment you could imagine, having seen at least seven doctors over 15 years. I have tried everything from zolpidem and similar drugs (no improvement with these drugs) and the benzos (tolerance problems, not good for long term use), to hydroxyzine (ineffective) and trazodone (still cannot sleep and makes me feel ill the next day). Also I have tried antipsychotics like quetiapine and all sorts of other drugs, and really either they do not work at all, the tolerance issue makes them unsuitable for long term use, or else the side effect profile is too nasty for daily use. I have even been treated with SSRIs and other drugs to rule out underlying anxiety issues. I find myself a very calm person, and my friends know me that way. Also I have been seeing various therapists for years in terms of learning to deal with modifying my lifestyle. I also meditate, practise yoga etc., and only the yoga/stretching helps, but just barely. Finally I was living in Japan for a while where a local psychiatrist put me on etizolam\u00a00.5mg to 2mg per night for sleep. I tried 0.5mg for a few nights without help. 1mg also did nothing. 1.5mg put me to sleep, but I still had this trouble with constantly waking up in the middle of the night as usual. So finally I tried 2mg, and that did the trick. For the first time in my life I could fall asleep at will and stay asleep all night until time to get up, and then not feel all sorts of sleepy/sickly side effects upon awakening. At least in the moment, this has been a wonder drug for me. Now I am back in the United States, so I get my etizolam sent in from abroad. I have been on it for three months at 2mg, sleeping successfully and living a better life, with no tolerance issues. Now, being that it is a benzodiazepine derivative, there is obviously the potential for tolerance. And while I know that with benzodiazepines tolerance is an issue, I also know that the potential for building a tolerance for each benzo depends on the condition being treated. For example my brother takes clonazepam daily for anxiety for years at the same dosage, and while most of the effects have worn off due to tolerance (euphoria, sedation), the anxiolytic effect is as strong as ever and he remains without unbearable anxiety just as well as the day he started. At the same time, if you are looking to \"get high\" on clonazepam, that effect, you might know, is gone pretty fast. And the anticonvulsant effects only last for a certain amount of time, too. I am sure none of this is new to you, and I only mean to point out that with the benzos the potential for tolerance depends largely on the symptom being treated. Might be a few weeks of good use of clonazepam for seizures, only a few days for getting high, a month for sedation but years for anti-anxiety (making these numbers up, but you see what I mean). And I only put this all here because I am afraid of getting this response that \"people build a tolerance to etizolam and so it must not be taken long term.\" Because the question is to which effect do people build a tolerance, and how quickly, and what percentage of the people, etc. So Iam wondering if there is a strong tolerance effect to etizolam for its anti-anxiety and (in Japan, at least) anti-depressant effect, how does it do for its anti-insomnia abilities? What is the consensus on this matter, and what is your own personal opinion? And has there been any research done on it at all, or is it all based on clinical observation/clinical wisdom? If there have been any studies could you point me to one or two? Have you personally prescribed etizolam for sleep? And if so, have you ever done it for daily use? And is it always, in your case, used only in the short term? And if you have seen patients use it for more than a few weeks/months, was there a point where it just was no longer effective? And how long did it tend to take for it not to be effective anymore? And finally, is it the case that it tends to work quite well for long term use for some patients but not for others, and if so, any idea as to whether it tends to work well that way for more patients or for less? Thank you so much for any help you can give me. Doctor: Hi. First of all I would like to congratulate you and your doctor for finding a solution for your long standing problem which caused lots of impairment at your end. Regarding your statement \"people build a tolerance to etizolam and so it must not be taken long term\" I like to clarify that it is only partially true. Although tolerance is a major issue with all benzos, research has found that etizolam is associated with \"Reverse Tolerance\" a phenomena in which requirement for dose decreases with passage of time in contrast to tolerance. In two different studies reverse tolerance has been found for anti anxiety effects and anticonvulsant properties. In one another study etizolam was found to be associated with no tolerance for anti convulsant properties. Regarding its antidepressant properties, I am unable to comment at this moment as there are no studies which conclusively state that it has antidepressant properties. But if you extrapolate findings from available studies I am of the opinion that etizolam is significantly not associated with tolerance for its sedative, hypnotic and antidepressant properties. There is no consensus about development of tolerance for insomnia treatment as it is not available in countries which drive research in psychiatry. Other than this at present, it is recommended for short term use that might be the reason that no one knows its effect or side effect over long term use. According to your history that states you are maintaining on the same dose (2mg) for last three months, it is unlikely that you are going to develop tolerance for its sedative properties, as development of tolerance is affected by particular drug along with genotype of individual. Regarding my personal clinical experience with Etizolam: I started prescribing Etizolam in June 2010 when an Indian pharma company launched it in India. Since that time I used this drug for anti-anxiety properties in majority of individuals. Two of my patients who were prescribed etizolam are maintaining on the same dose for more than two years on the same dose (1 mg at bed time for insomnia and 0.25 mg twice a day for GAD Generalized Anxiety Disorder). Fortunately till date both of them are maintaining well till date and none of them complained of development of tolerance. Although it is recommended for short term use for the insomnia patient (almost duplicate copy of you) has found this drug after almost 1 year of suffering and he refused to discontinue this saying that \" doctor you know I am suffering for all these years. None of your prescriptions worked for me.\" After taking all precautions I decided to continue prescribing etizolam to that particular patient. Although my experience is limited (around 4 years) with Etizolam and it is difficult to make statement about etizolam but with available literature and according to my clinical experience I consider etizolam as non tolerance developing drug although it acts on benzodiazepine receptors. The reason behind different property of etizolam in comparison to other benzos, lies in its structure. Etizolam is exactly not a benzodiazepine. Its benzene ring is replaced by thiophene ring. It belongs to thienodiazepine derivative that acts on various benzodiazepine receptors. I hope I answered your query but still if you feel some thing is left, please contact me again. I will be happy to answer everything related to psychiatry. If you feel it is appropriate to have a face to face discussion you can get an appointment for an online video consultation.

If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods? Doctor: Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

My mother was a fish seller till her age of 61 which involved lifting fish box. Now for the past two years she is not going for work. Though she is active at home, is not able to walk as before. Last year, I consulted a bone specialist nearby our town. But after consulting him she is not even walking 100 m. Before that she used to go to our nearest town walking around 1 km. I have attached the previous consultation reports. The doctor had also done some blood test. Most of the blood tests were normal including blood pressure and blood sugar. But there is a slight increase in gamma globulins. I have attached her back x-ray too. I am much worried that after consultation her problem has increased. Please guide me further. Doctor: Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. Thank you for uploading the lab reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Her main issue is her back pain with back bone problems. She has got kyphosis (outward curvature of spine-hunch back) in the lumbar vertebral region. She has got the narrowing of the intervertebral spaces due to age related degeneration of the intervertebral discs at many places. In simple words, she has got issues with cushions that are naturally placed between the two vertebrae of the backbone for properly supporting the body weight. There is no big issue with gamma globulins and that slight change has no impact on her overall health. 1. Improve her diet by giving her plenty of water, salmon fish and a good amount of fruits and vegetables. 2. Give her tablet Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) for pain reduction. 3. Lumbosacral corset for supporting the back and to reduce the pain. 4. Apply Voltaren (Diclofenac topical) gel, massage gently and apply heat pad for soothing effects. 5. Apply ThermaCare heatwraps on the painful and pins and needles sensation areas. 6. Give her by mouth capsule Lyrica (Pregabalin). She will feel much better. Proper rest is necessary for her. If you feel nothing is helping her anymore, please consult a good orthopaedician to get a detailed physical evaluation after an MRI and get the treatment according to that."

But, I started seeing vision changes and that seems to correlate with it. There are no floaters or flashes, but I have had this constant spot in my right eye for the past month or so. It looks exactly like the imprint light can leave in your eyes after staring at the sun or a light bulb for a long time and then looking away. It has been constantly there and never fades. It feels almost like this one section of my vision is more sensitive to light. It has got progressively more prominent. It was faint at first, but now it is very obvious and distracting when I am reading or working at the computer. It does not obstruct my vision and it is just incredibly distracting me. It is in a crescent shape. It is most obvious when I am working on the computer screen and then look away to a darker background. Also, when I blink rapidly, I see it and it almost looks like a strobe light. I had a dilated eye examination this morning and the ophthalmologist told me that there were no signs of bleeding or edema in my eyes. He said the vision changes I described were not a cause for concern, but at the same time he was not able to explain why I am seeing this.\u00a0It is causing me a particular concern because once it started and I smoked another cigarette, it seemed to become more prominent, brighter, and more obvious in my field of vision. That really freaked me out and caused me to throw the rest of the pack away immediately.\u00a0I have had pretty decent blood sugar control and all of my A1Cs have been in the 5.5 to 6.5 range since I was diagnosed initially.

This is best for bad breath or stinking mouth and halitosis. Use three times a day for two weeks. Another very helpful method for the cure of bad breath is saline water mouth rinses. (Take a small cup of lukewarm water, add 1/4th teaspoon of salt in it). Do these rinses three times a day for 10 days. It will help. But chronic halitosis or mouth stinking is not a healthy thing. You must get the cause identified. This bad breath can be due to any systemic problem (like acidity, stomach ulcer, etc.), mouth breathing habit, poor oral hygiene. Try to fix the problem accordingly first. If you need scaling, get it done and then start with mouthwash or mouthrinses. You will get rid of bad breath soon. Two times brushing of teeth in a day is quite enough, excessive brushing can damage the enamel of your teeth. You can give followup after two weeks. Along with a close picture of your teeth with gums can help me diagnose your cause of mouth stinking more properly."

I have stopped Seroquel, and my exogenous administration of testosterone is reduced to half from 700 to 387. Do Seroquel increases the prolactin levels? My sugar levels drop quickly after meals, and I have low genetic TBG. If I increase my exogenous testosterone back to the previous level, will my TT3 level get lowered? I am on Propranolol and my last Seroquel dose of 25 mg. It was affecting my eye sight, so I stopped it, and my FT4 was always low after Hashimoto\u2019s recovery. Doctor: Hello. I understood your question, and the answer is: An increase in testosterone dosage will not suppress T3 (triiodothyronine) levels. It will take some time to recover from the consequences due to the long term administration of Seroquel (Quetiapine). Propranolol can cause low testosterone levels, so no point in artificially increasing the testosterone."

It is very important to maintain hydration of the child by giving ORS (as per the weight of the child) with each loose stool. It is not advised to use any medications that stop the loose motions immediately in such a small child due to the risk of widespread infection.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

This should be evaluated properly. If you are obese then high weight could be the cause of low levels. This might be contributing to poor erection. Testosterone injections are one option for improving the levels. You can talk with your doctor about that. Drugs like Sildenafil or Tadalafil can be used on SOS basis to improve the erection and can help you. Exercise daily and have healthy balanced food.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

When I stand up straight or lie down pain, numbness, tingling is present. I have to sleep in a fetal position with legs curled up. I cannot arch my back without pain.

Will epidural injections help or is surgery an only option? 4. Will this resolve on its own? This condition is adversely affecting my life. Can I stretch the painful areas? In other words, can I arch my back to stretch even though it hurts, or can I do stretching that will not hurt, like lifting the leg to the chest? Kindly help. Doctor: Hello. From your symptoms, it sounded like LC stenosis but having looked at your MRI, and it is evident that there are disc bulges prolapse at multiple levels on the left side leading to your remaining sided symptom. L4/5 and L5/S1 showed lateral canal stenosis and possibly a far lateral bulge leading exiting nerve irritation. Yes, you should benefit from a directed nerve root injection at the two levels on the left side. What I cannot explain is the upper thigh pain. No swimming per se should not a disc bulge or a prolapse unless you have done something getting in or out of the pool. Arching your backward is not recommended as this will not help relieve the pressure may make it worse. I hope this helps."

What this means is assume that the chance of recurrence of a particular tumor is 80 percent. That means out of 100 people, 80 will get cancer again. Suppose all these 100 take paleo, only 50 will get cancer again. Now assume the chance of recurrence of a particular tumor is 30 percent. That means Of 100 people, 30 will get cancer again. Suppose all these 100 take paleo, no one will get cancer again. So, if you have already got a tumor, you have to take paleo.

I am concerned this growing spot is a very young melanoma (since it is growing). It is been three days and the scab already peeled off and it seems to still be there (although that could be irritation from the freezing). How long do I need to go back and have it biopsied to know? I can send photos if needed. Doctor: Hello. I saw your clinical pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). In your recent picture, the lesion looks like seborrheic keratosis (harmless), it looks rough and raised. I cannot confirm what it is with this picture. I am sorry dear, the picture becomes little blurry when I try to zoom it, to appreciate finer features. I am very sure your dermatologist would have looked at the spot with a dermoscope. With dermoscopy, the dermatologist can make out abnormal changes that are concerning. Even if it is doubtful feature leaning towards melanoma, your dermatologist would have done a shave biopsy to rule out that minimal possibility. After cryotherapy, the area becomes dark, it scabs and falls off after five to seven days. I can understand your concern as you had a melanoma in situ removed recently. Observe the treated spot for another week, allow the spot to heal completely. After a week, if you feel it is still there, then you can undergo shave biopsy which would say precisely what it is.

If most of your answers are \"yes\" i suggest to say to your parents that you have to see a surgeon right away to be evaluated. If not i will still suggest you to see a surgeon, but you can take your time. Lumps should be evaluated properly and will be treated accordingly depending on the physical findings.

It is about the size of a 5 cent Australian piece, and I can feel it under my skin almost as if the skin moves over the top of it. So, I do not think it is a dermatological thing. I have little spots around my pubic area but I think that is because of the hairs. This feels like something different. It does not look inflamed from the outside, and it is not sore to touch (just a bit tender). It feels like it rolls underneath my skin but stays in the same spot obviously. Doctor: Hi. If I am not wrong 5 cents Australian piece is around 2 cm in size. As you have described, it is a lymph node in your inguinal region. The human body has about 600 lymph nodes. Their role is to clean antigens from the extracellular fluid. It helps in fighting inflammation and infection. Lymphadenopathy (LAP) is the term to describe the conditions in which lymph nodes become abnormal in size, consistency, and number. A normal-sized lymph node is usually less than 1 cm in diameter. An inguinal lymph node size up to 1.5 cm should be considered normal. Lymphadenopathy can be called generalized when it affects two or more parts of the body. Enlarged lymph nodes associated with significant fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss (more than 10% in less than six months) are considered as red flags. It required an urgent evaluation for lymphoma. Those are not present in your case. Pain and tenderness on a lymph node is a non-specific finding. It is typically due to minor infection. Other causes of the inguinal lymph node are benign reactive lymphadenopathy, sexually transmitted disease, cellulitis or local infection, etc. Benign reactive inguinal lymphadenopathy is seen in patients who walk barefooted outdoors. If it is tender you can take Paracetamol. Keep watch. Avoid walking barefoot. Keep hygiene of your private parts. If it persists and associated pain or fever or other site engaged lymph nodes, you will need an evaluation. I hope this helps. Regards."

As far as I have noticed in the picture you have sent, the region seems to be good and healing. The yellow substance stuck mostly looks like food debris locked around the socket (sometimes it could be the debris swirled around the suture thread in case if it is removed by now). Try gargling with warm salt water to get rid of it. Vigorous gargling is not advisable when it is less than three days since you got it extracted. If you are unsuccessful in this, then I reckon you visit the dentist back for a review and get a saline flush in that region or the dentist would manually remove the debris with a tweezer without affecting the healing gums.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Drug therapy includes Sildenafil, Tadalafil, and Vardenafil. Behavioral therapy includes Masters and Johnson technique. It is difficult to explain here but you can google it, and try to practice it or can consult a psychiatrist in person for detail discussion on it. Also, you need to rule out medical conditions associated with erectile dysfunction namely cardiovascular disease, thyroid dysfunction, vitamin deficiencies, substance use disorder, etc. If the problem persists then consult a psychiatrist in person for evaluation.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy.

Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you. Doctor: Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

On a two-balloon endoscopy of the small intestine, colonoscopy with ileoscopy, CT, MRI revealed nothing. So, we can determine the location of spasm only with X-ray and barium follow through. I did barium follow through several times (with an interval of six months). There was a disagreement among the doctors and they agreed about etiology of obstruction (dynamic/spastic), but cannot decide the location of the spasm. Treatment recommended is therapeutical - endoscopic injections of Botulinum toxin into the intestine (they call it chemical denervation, and recommend it because that conservative drug therapy does not help. Therefore, it is important to know the exact location of spasm. I ask for help in this matter. I am attaching the links. The study was started 11 and half hours after swallowing barium. The last shot was taken 35 hours after swallowing barium. So, there is stasis/stagnation about 30 hours in the small intestine. The most important question is the exact location of the spastic area. It is important to know the location and length of spasm in centimeters, at least in some ranges (if absolute accuracy is not possible, but if it is possible, at least within the margin of error of a few cm, that would be perfect). This information is necessary for the doctor to develop further treatment tactics. Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello. The condition idiopathic spastic intestinal obstruction/spastic ileus is a unique and rare condition indeed. In the barium pictures, the involved area is usually seen like a sudden constriction of a segment of the small or large bowel. The segment involved can be visualized as a thin pencil-like narrowing. There can be one location involved or it can involve multiple short or long segments. The usual findings are a sudden narrowing of the bowel for a few inches. Your barium swallow images done on the 5th (attachment removed to protect patient identity), show a normal transit of barium in the esophagus and into the stomach lumen. The study is started at 10.10 AM and we can see the barium in the jejunum in the 11.27 image. There is no narrowing in the segments visualized. In the 06.03 PM image, there is a suspicious short segment of sudden narrowing of bowel in the right lower pelvis and is likely one of the affected areas. In the second series of images done on the 18th, there is no severe narrowing in any particular area. The ileocecal junction is seen narrow in some of the images but that can be normal.

The biochemistry examination revealed urine spot protein to creatinine ratio 2.19 and moderate grade proteinuria. Doctor: Hi.  Your baby probably has a problem with his kidneys. A urine spot protein to creatinine ratio of more than two usually suggests that your baby is losing a lot of protein through his kidneys called nephrotic range proteinuria.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I went to the doctor that day and she just drew my blood and said I was anemic and not pregnant. I followed up with a gynecologist, he said it could be endometriosis and everything else is fine. He also told me that I have high risk HPV. I have had a transvaginal ultrasound that showed everything pretty much fine except for the follicles on my ovaries. I am so confused about my health condition. Please help. Doctor: Hi. I hope you are feeling better now. Have you been started on Iron tablets? I would suggest tablet Livogen XT (combination of Iron, Folic acid and Zinc sulfate) once at night with a glass of lime juice for better absorption. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. Continue the above for three months minimum. You will feel better in about one or two weeks. I also suggest a deworming medicine tonight and skip Iron tablet. A single dose of 400 mg Albendazole is sufficient. From tomorrow onwards restart the Iron tablets. This should take care of the anemia. With regards to the endometriosis, this is something that can only be confirmed by seeing with the eyes under a laparoscopy. If your doctor wants to take a look under laparoscopy, then you should consider it once your hemoglobin is back up. The advantage is that any endometriotic lesions can be burnt with cautery at the same time and if it is a fibroid which is causing these symptoms, then it can also be treated simultaneously by laparoscopy if it is average sized. Endometriotic cysts can also be treated if found at the same time. The rest of your scan sounds normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity) so do not worry.

The right does not drain often. The left drains every day more than once a day. The left has become really swollen and painful recently. I am not sure of what to do because I now understand that the discharge means it is infected and it is hard for the surgery, if infected. Plus they have been infected for so long. I have also read that after surgery, it could reoccur. Doctor: Hi. Let me answer your query in parts. It is a developmental anomaly, a branchial cleft anomaly. Once we remove the whole sinus tract, it does not recur. To see till where it extends one must do a fistulogram scan. When infected we do not do surgery. We do culture sensitivity and institute appropriate antibiotics and clear infection and plan for surgery later. It is a curable problem. Do send us a picture of the ears both sides and send to me."

      "tgt": "I have extreme sensitivity to cold in the area of oldest filling. Why?",
      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I had not been to a dentist in about a decade (I am 30 years old) till five months back. I had not had any problems or noticeable cavities till about a year ago, when a fair few seemed to pop up all at once, a few on the front of my incisors. Now I admit, I had slacked off in adulthood on brushing, just once a day did not floss, and had slacked off even more in the last two years due to extreme depression (a mixture of forgetting and just not caring). But I have now started getting the cavities filled, the ones visible when I smile with the composite resin, the first cavities done this way were filled about two months ago, the most recent about three weeks ago.I noticed some sudden extreme sensitivity to cold in the area of the oldest filling, went to look in the mirror, and I noticed there is the start of a hole in the resin (more of a pit or dent, really, than a true hole, at this point), and also noticed that there is just starting to be the barest hint of degradation in the most recent one. And I would like to know why. Since going back to the dentist, I have started to try to be better about my oral care, I am still not where I am sure any dentist would like me to be, again due to the depression. But I do make sure I brush at least once. I mean the math, to me, just does not seem to add up, even considering the resin likely is not as strong as tooth enamel. If it took literal years for the cavities to even start forming when I was brushing once a day, how is it the resin is breaking down so fast when I am keeping to that schedule, and about half the time actually do what I should be doing (that is brushing twice a day and flossing). Are my dentists just using substandard resin materials, or (is that even a thing that is possible?) I am worried because I have a fair number of cavities left to go, some of them to be filled with the composite resin, and if they are going to break down this fast even with proper or most proper care, I mean, the hell am I supposed to do, just not eat? Doctor: Hey. Do not worry. The reason could be either your enamel is weak or maybe you are chewing or biting hard on those filled surfaces in the front areas of teeth. The composite filling does not have much strength when done in deep caries of back teeth or a larger portion of front teeth. We usually advise patients with composite filling in front tooth edges not to bite there. Can you please send me the image of the areas where you have complaints? And if you had taken depression medicines in the past, it can cause dryness of mouth, which in turn causes caries or cavity (new and progression in old ones). Regarding oral hygiene, more than the quantity of brushing, the brushing method matters as wrong technique will not cleanse plus cause abrasion of teeth leading to sensitivity. Follow bass sulcular method (google it for video), gargle after every meal. Reduce the use of mouthwash as it can cause staining and dry mouth. Take care.

Now, three weeks before, I started getting giddiness and the tinnitus continues the whole day in both ears. I went to another ENT specialist.

I am a vegetarian with no smoking and drinking habit. Please look into my MRI and give your opinion. Doctor: Hi. Your MRI looks grossly normal. In an unexplained tinnitus like this, you need further investigations to rule out two rare conditions, jugular bulb abnormalities and sigmoid sinus diverticulum (sinus wall abnormality). You will require high resolution CT of the temporal bone to look for any bony abnormalities. Another possibility is dural arteriovenousfistula dAVF; however, MRI does not show any evidence for this. You will need cerebral DSA (digital subtraction angiography) for excluding this condition because of tinnitus. The same test will also identify jugular vein and sigmoid sinus problems.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I have been having back, knee and foot pain and numbness for some time. So, I am wondering if I should see professional help? It started about a year or more ago, and then it was merely the lower left side of my back. It would go numb for a brief time after riding for about thirty or more minutes. However, as time has progressed the pain has gotten worse, and mostly the pain is in my left knee. I own apartment buildings, and I love working on the properties, but it is beginning to wear on my body being a 53-year-old male. Yesterday was especially hard because I was on a ladder a lot and it makes my lower back and left knee hurt when I use a ladder, and I went up and down three flights of steps numerous times moving supplies from one apartment to another, and it took its toll. Therefore, today I am experiencing pain in my left knee on the side of my knee and in the back. Last night, I woke up with a lot of pain in my left knee and it was a burning sensation, but my back did not hurt as it usually does. I had a baker's cyst many years ago on this same knee, and my doctor advised me to take it easy for a few days and take Advil. Once I did as he recommended the pain went away and until recently I have had no problems with my knee. One more thing most of the time when I feel a sharp pain going through the left part of my lower back it makes my foot numb. If I sit or lie down and pull my leg up to my chest it gives me a lot of relief. Most of the time if I am feeling this sensation in my lower back and it starts to go down to my left leg (pulling my leg up to my chest for a couple of minutes) will usually make the pain go away completely. Most of my time is spent about ten hours a day at my desk working, and while my favorite thing to do is work on my properties. I have to sometimes hire people because of spending so much time at my desk. At one time (about ten years ago) I used to lift weights (free weights) and workout on a cross-trainer for two to two and a half hours a day (from Monday to Friday). Although as I got more responsibility for my work, I started cutting back on the exercising and eventually gave it up altogether. So, I do not do anything outside of working on my properties for exercise, and I hope to start lifting weights again and doing cardio because my waist has gotten up to a 34 and I want to stop it from expanding more. However, I am afraid to start any exercise routine before I find out what is going on with my left side. The pain I am referring to is strictly from my waist down the leg and to my foot. I have no problems with my right side, and if a doctor recommends surgery, it is not going to happen because I grew up with a dad that had Perthes. And I have seen how he has suffered his entire life and how many times doctors have replaced hips telling him this one is the last one only for him to have to go back over and over until he is finally in a wheelchair. Sorry, there is one more thing my primary doctor has retired, and I have not been sick in over seven years, so I have no primary doctor to give me a referral, but I have to do something about this pain. Thanks for any advice or ideas you can give me because I always worry it might be cancer because my grandmother died of osteogenic sarcoma. I am currently taking Vyvanse, Sawpametto, Vitamin C, Magnesium and multivitamin. Doctor: Hello, Welcome to icliniiq.com. Your symptoms (back pain radiating in the knee and leg) are suggestive of a bulging (slipped) intervertebral disc in the lumbar region, which is causing irradiating radicular pain in the knee. For this reason, I would recommend consulting with a neurologist for a physical examination and a lumbar spine CT (computed tomography) scan or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) study. Prolonged sitting position or weight lifting could be the cause of such clinical situation. For this reason, I would recommend having some rest, avoiding prolonged standing up or sitting position, and avoid weight lifting. Painkillers (Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen), coupled with a muscle relaxant (Flexeril) can help improve the pain. Local warm packs on the lower back and massage or physiotherapy can help improve your situation. A nerve conduction study would help to determine the possible damage to your nerves. You should discuss it with your doctor on the above tests. I hope this helps. Bulging lumbar disc. Lumbar column CT scan or MRI scan. Nerve conduction study. Painkillers, muscle relaxants, and physiotherapy. Avoid weight lifting, prolonged sitting or standing up position."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I knew her from the last three months and had very good communication with her. She said to be working in a good company. We went out one day and had sex. I used a condom while doing it. But during that time I had a cut in my hand and I had once put my finger in her vagina and also the used condom. I also happened to put my tongue in her vagina. The girl is in good health and I even asked her twice if she is HIV positive but she told she is not. I had this anxiety in my mind. I searched the online sites for the early signs and found that I a had little back pain and numbness and throat is feeling little strange. I have little dizziness sometimes. When I am trying to sleep I am shaking from the inside and not able to sleep. It is just seven days since I had sex. I am too scared and not sure what to do. Yesterday, I was feeling a little bad today it is little better for me, but my hands shake a little. Do you think it is possible that I have any symptoms of HIV? Should I look for a common symptom? As I said before the girl is just fine, no noticeable health issues. Do you still think it is possible for me to get HIV from her? What step should I take now? Doctor: Hello. I have noted your concern. I would say that you have a very low risk of HIV due to unprotected oral sex. Unprotected oral sex is still less of a risk as compared to unprotected vaginal or anal sex but the risk is not zero with oral sex. Protected vaginal sex is safe and a skin cut on the finger that is not freshly bleeding is not a risk. A cut that is a few hours old is self-sealing. As far as your symptoms are concerned they are non-specific and partly due to anxiety. Anyways you should take an antigen/antibody HIV screening test (P24Ag and anti-HIV antibody test) at four weeks and at six weeks for a conclusive result. Regards.

BP 140/80, pulse 96/ min, creatinine 1.3, fasting sugar 125, postprandial 157. From a few months, my mother is suffering from chest pain. The doctor told it is chronic stable angina. All other tests are done like Na, K, hemoglobin, urea, and uric acid. The reports are quite fine. Our family doctor suggests me to take angiography. So, what should I do now? Please suggest. She is taking the following medicines: Aciloc RD, Glimmy 2, Nexovas, Telmikaa40, Febugood 40, Lipikind 10 and Glypten 20. Doctor: Hello. With these kidney function tests, she can perform the coronary angiography. I agree with her doctor's recommendation because this would help identify possible coronary artery stenosis and also perform angioplasty, if necessary. Another test which can help investigate the presence of coronary ischemia is Dobutamine cardiac stress test. If this test results positive, the next step would be performing a coronary angiography.

I was an alcoholic taking 360 ml of brandy every day and recently a month back, I have quit that habit. I now want to focus on my health. I went to a diabetic center and started Trulicity for weekly insulin for sugar control. I gave urine culture ten days back and the report shows Enterococcus faecalis with a colony count greater than 1000000 and only four antibiotics as susceptible, namely, Cefotaxime, Meropenem, Imipenem, and Vancomycin. My diabetic doctor has prescribed Meronem 500 mg injection twice a day for five days. My question is:  I cannot afford Meronem 500 mg as 10 injections are very expensive. I found that Cefotaxime is the cheapest among the four of them. Can I have that injected for five days, twice a day? Doctor: Hi. Yes, you can take Cefotaxime 1 gm twice a day for five days after a test dose for allergy. Controlling your blood glucose levels will help to lower the episodes of UTI (urinary tract infection). Also, get a sonography done with pre and post void urine. For more information consult a urologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/urologist"

If these type of facilities are not available near you, you can also try anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxers to help ease the discomfort. A most common prescription for disc herniation that is prescribed is Motrin 800 mg (Ibuprofen) three times a day and Baclofen 10 mg two to three times a day. A proper diagnosis is required as well as making sure there is no contraindication for these medications. Boswellia is a natural herb that you can try as well."

Since you are working in the night, you might be losing out the necessary sleep. So you are unable to focus entirely during work. It is essential for an adult human being to get seven to eight hours of quality sleep every day. Once you finish your job in the morning, try to have a hearty breakfast and then close the windows of your room with a dark curtain that blocks the entry of light. Request your family to keep the house quiet and try to sleep at a stretch for at least six to seven hours. It will help you unwind and relax. During the weekends, try to avoid staying out for long periods. Try to catch up the lost sleep. Some foods that help in inducing sleep are dairy products, bananas, and almonds. To keep you awake and energetic during work, avoid eating heavy meals before and during work. Eat small meals at frequent intervals. Green tea, dark chocolate, and fruits may help you to stay awake when you feel drowsy. Please remember that the best time to sleep is the night time. Keep looking for better work opportunities, and sometime in future, you can move on to a job that lets you sleep well at night."

Patchy regions of increased T2 signal intensity within the periatrial deep white matter are primarily with the terminal zones. The hippocampi are both relatively small and with mildly prominent flair signal. Doctor: Hello. The hippocampus is a structure deep-seated at the level of the temple (at the sides of the forehead). It is significantly small in a condition called medial temporal sclerosis, which can give rise to epilepsy. That is why they have mentioned that the hippocampus is relatively small but, there is no atrophy as such, so the changes in the hippocampus are not contributing much to epilepsy. How to find out whether it is contributing to epilepsy? Your doctor would correlate the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) findings with EEG (electroencephalogram) pattern and find out. Regarding T2 hyperintensities in the deep parietal region, it is just suggestive of increase water or myelin content in the deep area of the brain behind the ears but in front of occiput. This is not producing any signal changes in other sequences than T2, so this may not be significant at all. I hope you understand this. MRI findings are too technical to convert them in simple terms.

My tooth was extracted yesterday, still bleeding heavily. I had fever through the day. Doctor: Hello. Most dentists will offer pain medications if the procedure can reasonably be expected to cause pain that cannot be managed by OTC medication. In your case, I wonder why he has not prescribed any because extracting a third molar root can be a little difficult and the patients will feel pain and discomfort for two to three days. I suggest your dentist should have prescribed antibiotics like Amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily for three days and analgesics like Ibuprofen or Acecloparacetamol combination three times daily for three days. You should definitely check with your dentist about the medication. Some reasons why he has not given could be because of the stress the analgesics will cause to your liver when taken in overdose as I can see you have already taken some painkillers in the past. Or maybe he might have quickly taken the roots of your molar out and was expecting a quick healing. Anyway, if you still have pain you should definitely go back and check with your dentist.

I do not like anyone feeling around in my mouth and knowing about this cavity is making me even more nervous for going there today. I have had teeth pulled in the past and I hate everything about it, but I am not sure they could just fill in this cavity. Doctor: Hello. As a human we all carry some kinds of secrets or fear back in our head. I felt glad as you have the courage to admit that, most people cannot. So be proud of that. I think you need a scaling too, as you have not brushed for a long time its leads to swollen gingiva that might be the reason of uncomfortable using a brush. As you have caries and sensitivity associated, you might not necessarily need an extraction. If the caries has progressed alot, root canal can be done to save your tooth. Betadine Mouthwash, Gargle in lukewarm water 2-3 times a day. Do not worry, use it, if any foul breath that will be covered and your secret will be safe. As you feel uncomfortable using a brush, you can brush using your finger and toothpaste. That way your mouth will also be clean and issue with bristle will also be resolved. You can also take capsule Sporidex 500 mg one apsule BD for 5 days, tablet Zerodol SP 1 tablet BD for 5 days, capsule Pan D one capsule BD before meal for 5 days. You will be needing a scaling to remove any tartar. Once done you can start practising brushing using a soft bristle brush (even a baby brush will do for a start). I am confident you will succeed. But you have to start the habit and you will get used to it, trust me. You can train and motivate yourself by rewarding a candy or anything special. By that way you can overcome your fear and gain comfidence. I am glad that I could be someone whom you can share a secret. I wish you good luck. You can trust me and ask if any further query. I will be happy to help further. Hope your treatment goes fine. Do as I asked you to do. You are brave, you will be fine. I am confident about that."

Is going from A cup to C cup (350 cc) then going from C cup to possible D cup (500 cc filled to 600 cc) that big of a difference? Doctor: Hello. I can understand your confusions. Let me tell you one thing. The implants are usually measured by three things, the volume, the base diameter and the height (profile). So the implants chosen will be on the basis of all the three criteria. An implant of 500 cc will have the capacity to be filled almost up to twice its volume (1000 cc) without being ruptured. It depends upon the surgeon that what volume will be good in your case. Again the material and shape of the implant determine the distribution of the additional fill. That all will be pre-decided by your surgeon. Going from A to C and then to D is not that much of a difference provided you do have that much skin to accommodate. If not, then the doctor might suggest a few months interval in between for the skin to stretch.

Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning.

For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/dermatologist"

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Since a urine pregnancy test result was positive, you are pregnant. However, it is very important to confirm the same by scan and to locate the pregnancy to make sure it is in the uterus and not outside, which is called an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies cannot be aborted by pills and they present a dangerous situation, which requires immediate medical attention. You can terminate an intra-uterine pregnancy with pills up to 63 days after the first day of your last period. Following that, failure rates are high. The earlier the termination, the less risk of complications. Pills for termination cannot be prescribed over the phone or online, as it is illegal and dangerous. I would also advise you to consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online about receiving counseling on ending your pregnancy --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/obstetrician-and-gynaecologist Take care."

I have a doctor's appointment next week so I am holding off going. I did have a flu last week but was feeling better until I got this sore throat. I am not sure if this is still from the flu or something else. The first file is a picture from when the sore throat started two days ago and the second was from today. Doctor: Hi. I have seen the pictures. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Your description and the images point to acute granular tonsillopharyngitis, a bacterial throat infection, probably due to streptococcus. With low grade fever, throat pain, difficulty in speaking, swallowing and enlarged tender lymph nodes, you certainly need a course of antibiotics. I personally do not think that you should wait for a week to start any medications. For an antibiotic, you will need a prescription from a doctor who examines you in person. In case, if you must wait then you can try the following conservative management. In the meanwhile, I can advise you to take an anti-inflammatory medication like oral Paracetamol 500 mg twice daily after meals for five days along with antiseptic mouthwashes or gargles with Chlorhexidine or Betadine (dilution of 5 ml in 50 ml water and should not be swallowed) three times a day before and after meals with voice rest and adequate hydration with fluids (drink approximately two liters of water per day). Most throat infections would subside on their own without medications in eight to ten days. You can expect a recovery in two to three days if you take an antibiotic along with the supportive medications that I have recommended to you.  I hope this helps."

Why does this pattern occur? Please advise. Doctor: Hello. You have mentioned persistent low back pain for 5 years as your main problem. It is a known scientific fact that when you go to bed, the muscles in the body relax subconsciously, due to which any inflammatory pain is felt more. When you start with some activity, then that protective muscle spasm comes again and prevents the pain perception. Also after overnight inactivity, the disc pressures have been found to be very high in the mornings. So there are very high chances of prolapse early in the morning. Hence, I always advise my patients not to bend acutely forwards, or lift something very heavy, especially in the early morning time. Your pain could be due to multiple reasons - muscular, mechanical, discal in origin, etc. If you have a localized backache, with no associated neurological symptoms like radiation of pain to legs, numbness, paresthesias, electric shock-like sensations in legs and there are no systemic symptoms like swelling, fever, loss of appetite or weight, etc., my advice to you for the initial 2 to 3 weeks will be: If your condition does not improve after 2 to 3 weeks of this conservative management, then you need to undergo some investigations."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am seriously facing acne pimples problem. Sometimes they occur on my face when I masturbate. If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result. Is it okay to continue this? Doctor: Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I need an urgent help. I was on my fifth day of my periods and I made out with my partner. I had my pants and my panty on and he had his penis out. He ejaculated on my pant, and I saw that some portion of my panty was wet as well. And I felt wet in the skin of the lower portion of abdomen, where the vagina does not actually start, where it is only the human skin. I was very scared of it and I took a pill within one hour. And, two weeks later, I had the dark brown fluid, which ended in three days but it is not a very heavy flow and sometimes the thin tissue-like red stuff came out while peeing (like what happens during periods). So I guess I am alright? And there is no chance of pregnancy right? Doctor: Hello. How are you doing? I do not see any reason for you to worry. Let me start by giving few basic facts about the period. Usually, ovulation occurs on the 12th to the 16th day of periods and life of the egg is 24 hours. The life of the sperm is 72 hours. So there is no chance of the egg being available on day-5 of periods. The sperm will not survive until next ovulation. Just then, your period would have stopped, so even the inner lining of the uterus would have been so thin and unfavorable for a possible pregnancy. So, the pill was not needed, but what you did was absolutely right as had it been a week later you had a chance of pregnancy. The pill was taken at the right time. This pill is progesterone hormone in high dose. This suddenly increases the inner lining of the uterus and makes it unfavorable for a possible pregnancy. But being a single dose of the pill, the thickness will not stand, so it will break down and you will get periods within seven to 10 days. As there was already no inner lining, the bleeding you noticed was very less. Usually, the bleeding will be thick, dark with fleshy streaks, and slightly painful. There is absolutely no chance of pregnancy. The next period will be one month after this bleeding. So just relax, everything is fine.

And at times I will have the butterfly rash on my face. I did not get a follow up appointment with my rheumatologist until next month. Any recommendations with what I should ask or discuss would be greatly appreciated. I have attached my most recent labs and concerned with the results of the DNA ds. All other lab reports are normal and negative. Is lupus a possibility? I am currently taking Predisone 10 mg, Synthroid 125, Advair 100/50, and Zyrtec 10mg. Doctor: Hello. I have gone through your reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Considering the symptoms and medications you are taking, I would like to know a few more details. How is the sleep pattern? Do you get enough sleep or is it disturbed? Any early morning fatigue? Any dryness of eyes or mouth? Do you experience any joint swellings? Any recent history of irritability? Any forgetfulness which has developed recently? As per the investigations and ongoing treatment my suggestions would be: dsDNA has not much relevance in your case. It looks like a false positive value, mainly cause ANA is negative and ESR and CRP are normal. You are on too high dose of Prednisolone which is not good for bones and psoriasis as well. We need to cut down on the dosing. Methotrexate may be a good option as psoriasis can cause a lot of joint pains itself which will get better with it. Also, it is a good drug for removing steroids."

I can understand your concern. EllaOne (Ulipristal acetate 30 mg). It is rarely used as an immediate pill and you took it after condom split. Levonorgestrel is an instant pill. But there is no issue as both are potent drugs to prevent pregnancy. A second tablet is only needed if vomiting occurs within three hours. Seizure drugs will decrease its efficacy and 0.9 % to 2 % is the failure rate. Adverse effects are nausea, headache, and dysmenorrhea.

Premature ejaculation is defined as ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation, before the patient desires and before or within one minute of penetration. Frequently, performance anxiety could be a cause of premature ejaculation. In that case, you can take deep breathing for two minutes before sex. It will relax you enough. If you still feel anxious, you can take tablet Alprazolam 0.5mg half an hour before sexual activity. Remind yourself that you are having sex for mutual pleasure and relaxation. It is not an ordeal or duty where you are supposed to be the performer. There are many ways to treat premature ejaculation if it is not possibly due to anxiety. 1) The first technique is known as squeeze technique. In it, when you reach close to orgasm, you or your partner should squeeze on the ridge between the glans and the shaft of penis till the erection subsides. Then begin with your sexual activity once again. Repeat this a few times before you finally ejaculate. This will increase your time of ejaculation and also give you some voluntary control. 2) The second option is you can use Lignocaine spray (Shotmax spray). Spray once on the glans penis 15 minutes before sexual activity. It will reduce the extra sensitivity of the glans to normal level. You can also use 2% Lignox jelly (Lignocaine) instead of spray. 3) The third option is you can take tablet Dapoxetine 30 mg one hour before sexual activity. These techniques are sufficient to treat majority cases of premature ejaculation. 1. Anxiety. 2. Sensitive glans. Premature ejaculation. 1. Treat performance anxiety.  2. Squeeze technique. 3.

I understand that you are suffering from myopia of - 3.5D in your right eye and - 4D in your left eye. In case you want to use cod liver oil for reducing your glass power, I can tell you that it will not help. Myopia is a disease involving the refractive index, the curvature of the components of the eye and the length of the eyeball in the disease-free eyes. Consuming cod liver oil will not prevent or reverse any of the above-mentioned problems. Measures to reduce myopia progression include: 1. Avoid holding objects very close to your eye. The more the near work, the more will be myopia. 2. Visit your ophthalmologist for a yearly check of the power of your glasses. There are various options for refractive correction such as ReLex Smile, LASIK, etc., after your power stabilizes or you have completed your education. But for a 19-year-old, glasses are the best option, with occasional contact lens wear of less than six hours a day.

Followed by that the right tonsil remains the same and the left got subsided. In these four months, I had few episodes of pain in my ear. Also the glands in my right side of neck got swollen. I had Azithromycin, Erythromycin, Penicillin and Clavamax but the swelling of the tonsil and the glands did not go down? What should I do to prevent further episode? Does the cold temperature affect the tonsils? Doctor: Hi. With the conversation we had, I understand that you are an 18 year old male suffering from tonsillitis and you have been having acute exacerbation of the tonsillitis now. Due to the infection, you suffer from ear pain and swollen neck glands. You seem to be suffering from chronic tonsillitis. This resulted in episodes once a while leading to throat pain, difficulty in swallowing, ear ache, neck swelling, fever, etc. Tonsils are lymphoid organs which act as portals to remove offending agents like bacteria. However, in some individuals they themselves become the cause of infection. Infection from enlarged tonsils can spread to nose, ear or further down as throat infection which will cause great discomfort to the patients. Also, because of the same patient suffers from loss of days at work place or school or college. For your condition, I would suggest you to go ahead with tonsillectomy operation. This operation removes both the tonsils. It is done under general anesthesia and is done through the mouth. There will not be any incision outside. The reasons why I suggest you to go for the tonsillectomy operation are that, Few episodes of tonsillitis in a year can be successfully managed using medicines. However, in your case tonsillectomy operation is ideal as I explained above. In the meantime till we decide for surgery, please follow the instructions and suggestions I have given below. Some precautions to be taken are, It is true that cold climate can result in increased susceptibility to tonsillitis. Cold winds accompanied by consumption of road side or outside food can increase the chance of infection. Always use boiled water and desist from drinking water from local places. When tonsils are enlarged, the infection can move through the eustachian tube into the ear, complicate the condition and cause decreased hearing or ear discharge. Sometime the tonsils can cause referred pain to the ear though the infection may be restricted to throat. Lymph fluid from tonsils drains into neck nodes, more particularly the jugulodigastric node below the angle of jaw. Hence, the tonsillar infection will also infect the node and cause neck swelling. The swelling will resolve once the tonsillitis is cured. If the symptoms do not recede then please do the following tests. 1. Complete blood count including but not restricted to ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), platelet and lymphocytes. 2. Absolute eosinophil count. 3. Throat swab for culture and sensitivity. 1. Tonsillolith. 2. Acute Follicular Tonsillitis. 3. Acute Parenchymatous Tonsillitis. Acute exacerbation of chronic tonsillitis. I suggest you the following medications; however a complete and thorough physical examination is required to make a definitive diagnosis and prescribe the apt medication. 1. Take a stronger antibiotic, like Cefixime 200 mg, twice a day for 5 days. 2. Take an antibiotic that against anaerobic organisms, like Tinidazole or Ornidazole for 3 days after consulting with your doctor. 3. Take anti-inflammatory enzymes like trypsin-chymotrypsin tablet before food daily thrice for 2 days (Chymoral forte). 4. Take pain killers if necessary (Paracetamol 650 mg twice a day). 5. Hot salt water gargling daily three to four times and steam inhalation. 6. Follow the general instructions and precautions explained above. If the treatment does not help, you may need hospitalization and intravenous administration of medicines.

      "tgt": "My mentally retarded sister suffers from epilepsy even after many medication. Why?",
      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My 13-year-old sister has been diagnosed with various mental disorders since the age of 2. My parents have taken her to doctors since then because they have noticed that she was not developing like the other children. Almost every doctor gave another diagnostic such as autism (each doctor suggested a different type of autism) and mental retardation. When she was approximately 6 years old, she was also diagnosed with epilepsy. At first, the crisis was happening only while sleeping and they were detected during an EEG by a doctor. He prescribed the first anti-epileptic drug which was Ospolot. My sister felt very sick from it so another doctor told us to stop the medication. We did and then she started having a different type of crisis, absence crisis while awake. The doctor then prescribed Topram. Throughout the treatment with Topram, another type of crisis was added beside the absence, that is myoclonus. The doctor then prescribed Depakine instead of Topram. The absence crisis stopped, but the myoclonus stayed. Besides Depakine, she started taking Rivotril as well. With this combination, she stopped having a crisis for 3 months, but then the myoclonus started again and nocturnal epilepsy crisis was added as well. During this period, the doctor tried to replace Depakine with Lamictal (Lamotrigine), but my sister became intoxicated from it and started suffering from the Stevens-Johnson syndrome. She had to be at the hospital for one week to detox. My parents went to a different doctor then and he added Topram (Topamax / Topiramate) besides Rivotril and Depakine. This did not work again. My sister felt very sick from this combination while having a crisis both while being awake and asleep. She was then prescribed Depakine and Levetiracetam. The crisis while being awake stopped, but those while asleep still happen. At the moment, she takes Depakine, Levetiracetam, and Ospolot, but the nocturnal crisis persists. We do not know what to do anymore because the side effects of all these anti-epileptics have done a lot of damage. My sister is always very sleepy and drooling all the time. She already has mental issues so this just makes things so much worse. I know I wrote a lot, but I thought you should have as much information as you can. Here in our place, doctors are not that well informed about these diseases, so they do not really know how to deal with it. We also cannot afford to go to other countries anymore to check with other doctors. Any advice is very welcomed. Doctor: Hello doctor. I read your query and understand the feeling and problems faced by you. As I can see epilepsy is the main problem at this moment and even a combination of three drugs is not making her seizure-free. Despite her treatment, she continued to have seizures and in the medical language, she is known to have refractory epilepsy. I must acknowledge here that treatment of refractory epilepsy is one of the most difficult treatment in neurology and need considerable effort on part of doctors ad family members. Despite the effort we are not 100% successful in doing so. Regarding her treatment I will like to consider one of the two below mentioned strategies. Firstly, I need to know the dosage of current medications. If there is anything that can be changed I will prefer doing so as the current three medicines are rightly prescribed. The dose can be increased or decreased for one or more drugs. My second preference will be to try Trileptal (Oxcarbazepine). This meditation is less sedative in compare to her existing treatment and a definite role in the treatment of refractory epilepsy. Before a change can be made talk to your doctor about these two options. I hope this helps you."

I did not ejaculate and the condom slipped half way during the session and pulled that back. Is that a matter of concern? Shall I go for any test? Doctor: Hello. I went through your post. Slipping of the condom makes it an unprotected sexual intercourse and there is a small 1 % risk of getting STD although non-ejaculation makes it a lesser risk. You can test after two weeks for syphils and HIV by doing FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption) and CMIA for HIV after two weeks to be on the safer side. However, as the risk is very minute, there is no need to worry."

Particularly in the morning, severe sneezing occurs. Please help. Doctor: Hello. The possible causes for loss of smell are 1. Rhinitis. 2. Sinusitis. 3. Ethmoidal polyps. 4. Neurodegenerative diseases. 5. Vitamin B12, and Folic acid deficiency. 6. Tumor of the CNS (central nervous system). 7. Trauma. But in your case possible the cause is sinusitis with or without polyp. Rhinitis and sinusitis may lead to congestion and edema of mucosa, and also nerve endings may give rise to anosmia. 1. So use salt water gargling thrice a day for five days. 2. Use water vapor inhalation thrice a day for five days. 3. Use decongestants like Phenylephrine (tablet Lecope-AD) and anti-histamines to decrease congestion. 4. Avoid cool drinks and ice creams. 5. Use Otrivin nasal spray twice a day for five days. 6. Use tablet Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid 625 mg twice a day for five days. If symptoms are not improved please get done x-ray paranasal sinuses and nasal endoscopy then we come to know the cause.

Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you. Doctor: Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience. Child will eat properly now as he has recovered from illness."

He was feeling dizziness in the morning. He was given injections to reduce the heart rate and has taken Holter monitoring for one day. He had previously undergone two stent placements for blocks. According to his Holter reading, the doctor said his heart pauses for two seconds sometime in 24 hours. He has both bradycardia and tachycardia. They suggested him a biventricular pacemaker implantation that is a St. Jude medical pacemaker. He is allergic to Penicillin. During his discharge, he was prescribed the following medicines: Prolomet XL 25 mg two times a day, Xarelto once a day, Glycomet-GP 1 one and a half tablets a day, Ecosprin AV 150/10 capsules one a day, and Pantocid one a day. He takes his medicines regularly but once in 10 days, the palpitation occurs for about 10 to 15 minutes ranging 20 and sometimes 105 and then it stops. Palpitation does not come every day. The doctor says there is no need to worry. My concern is why does the palpitation occur even after the pacemaker implantation. Is there any way to stop the palpitation? Is it a serious issue. Please help me. Doctor: Hello, Welcome back to icliniq.com. I have gone through the report that you have provided. He is having the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome. In this case, the pacemaker avoids his bradycardia episodes only. For his tachycardia episodes, drugs can be given. Sometimes the drug controls it perfectly and sometimes it does not. You have to adjust the drug doses to control his tachycardia episodes. Consult your doctor for dose adjustment. In addition to the Prolomet (Metoprolol), I suggest Digoxin can also be added. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. Regards.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

And I am also taking ginger, lemon, honey, and apple cider vineger solution two teaspoons daily and giloy daily. I am observing that my BP is fluctuating. What should I do? Doctor: Hello. BP (blood pressure) and pulse are not constant parameters and are ever-changing. So it is entirely normal for them to show variations. We just have to watch that they are not crossing their limits. For systolic BP, 110 to 140 and for diastolic BP 60 to 90 is fine. And the resting pulse rate between 50 to 90 is appropriate for you. So, readings anywhere in between are fine. Also, BP fluctuations nowadays are more commonly seen due to the use of electronic BP apparatus, which are over-sensitive and cause variations. If you are using an electronic BP apparatus, then you should take three readings at a time with arm resting on the table and completely relaxed. And two matching readings are approximate BP of yours. However, if most of the BP readings are above or below this range then needs dose change, so let me know the details of your readings. You should make a chart of it by taking readings frequently, say three times a day (and each time three readings to know the average) for a week period. I hope this helps you."

A few days later, my left eye had some weird blurred vision which turned out to be corneal ulcer that is in the center and relatively big. I got treated immediately with heavy antibiotics Ceftin or Vigamox. After two to three weeks there was some improvement in vision, redness and the loss of epithelial cells is about 1.2 mm, after which I started taking eye steroids, and vitamin C three times a day. Unfortunately, I found out today that there is another small epithelial defect that opened under the first one (both are still very small). I have bad light sensitivity, and I would like to know if there is anything to be done now apart from waiting to get better. I have been told to be patient at least three months since the scarring is still prominent and central, although it is getting slightly better every time I see the doctor.

Sometimes it might take up to a year and more. It is however mandatory that you add to the list of eye drops that you are using a lubricant (artificial tears) because dryness is inevitable after any refractive surgery and once you are using eye drops that contain preservatives. You can use the lubricant every hour if you need but except the last hour before going to sleep. That is also very important if your job includes intense visual activities at the PC and or use of mobile devices. I wish you a fast recovery."

I say this because I do not know if it has anything to do with my problem. I am writing because I am having trouble finding online information about my lower back pain (behind the backbone). It does not hurt all the time. Mainly there is constant pain while walking, laying flat, or when leaning forward without support. Also, there is a real sharp pinch when my kids or spouse push on it either side. I am not sure if this matters, but once in a while when I stand from the couch there is a pinching pain in my lower front abdomen that goes away after a minute or two. Is there any idea you may have as to what is going on? I have been dealing with my back for a year now and my spouse is starting to tell me to get it checked out. I used to take only Ibubrufen when I get headaches. Doctor: Hi. I am sorry to hear about your pain, but I will try my best to help you. From history, the lower back pain may be related to mechanical or disc protrusion (PIVD) or some rare conditions like a kidney stone, or pelvic inflammatory disease. Mechanical and PIVD (prolapsed, herniated, or extruded intervertebral disc) can be differentiated by a dragging pain to one of your legs. In PIVD dragging pain is common. You may need an x-ray of your lower back. This pain is not related to an epidural, but as there is a pinching pain in front of the abdomen other causes should be ruled which is addressed with an ultrasound. As per your age, PIVD is a common symptom that is addressed initially with conservative management. The diagnosis is confirmed with an MRI. If it is PIVD need not take bed rest, you can do your daily activities. If pain reduces completely then start physiotherapy (back strengthening exercises)."

I saw your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), and from what you say, it may be a urinary tract infection. To rule out urinary tract infection, I would suggest urine culture. Left sided pain can occur if the left kidney and ureter is infected, with obstruction. From your ultrasound report, there seems to be no obstruction to urine flow from left kidney. But, ultrasonogram is prone to errors. I would suggest CT KUB (computed tomography of kidneys, ureter, and bladder) for better decision making.

Try to eat more vegetables like green leafy vegetables and not potatoes which contain high carbohydrates. You need to check 50 gm oral glucose tolerance test fasting and after 1 hour and 2 hours. If still high we need to assess the results and do further tests for the same and then decide whether to start insulin or not. Maintain blood sugar chart by checking it fasting, 2-hour post-meal, and before bedtime. Be in touch with a physician. Avoid rice, sweets, and sugary drinks. Take Folic acid 5 mg once daily.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I am a 30 year old Caucasian woman, 5 feet and 11 inches, 195 lbs and semi-active. My family has a history of heart problems. My mother, eldest brother, and father are all taking Metoprolol for heart arrhythmias and my maternal grandfather died of a heart attack at 55. My father also has a history of blood clots, though I tend to have the opposite problem with my blood not clotting easily at all most likely due to a vitamin K deficiency. My HDL cholesterol tends to be in the 20s and my LDL cholesterol tends to be in the 60s. I have had three different surgeries in my life. I have had a lateral release of the tendon on my left knee, my gallbladder removed, and two months ago, I had a cyst removed from my uterus. My issue is that I have been having palpitations off and on for seven months. They began after a severe case of the flu. At first, it was just the heart racing, but after a few months, it has become more of a skipped beat. The episodes last anywhere from one to 20 minutes. At first, the doctor thought it might be anxiety, but after a visit to a psychologist who specialized in anxiety, it was determined that anxiety was not the cause. The palpitations are not constant, but I also have other symptoms of lightheadedness, and pain in the chest on the left side (not sure if this is musculoskeletal or not). I also have digestive issues which may be a factor. I have had an echocardiogram with the following results:Left Ventricle: The left ventricular size is normal. LV posterior wall thickness was normal. LV systolic function was hyperdynamic. Left ventricular ejection fraction, by visual estimation, is 65 to 70 %. Spectral doppler shows a\u00a0normal pattern of LV diastolic filling.Right Ventricle: The right ventricular size is normal. RV wall thickness is mildly increased.Left Atrium: The left atrium is mildly dilated.Right Atrium: The right atrium is normal in size.Aortic Valve: Mid aortic valve thickening is present.Mitral Valve: The anterior and posterior leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace mitral valve regurgitation is seen.Tricuspid Valve: Trace tricuspid regurgitation is visualized. The tricuspid regurgitant velocity predicts an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 27.7 mmHg with normal pulmonary pressure.Pulmonic Valve: The pulmonic valve was not well visualized. Trace pulmonic valve regurgitation.Aorta: The aortic root and ascending aorta are structurally normal with no evidence of dilation.Pulmonary Artery: The pulmonary artery is not well seen.Pericardium: There is no evidence of pericardial effusion. I also had a 48-hour Holter monitor but was sick in bed the entire time. The results were:\u00a0Min HR: 50, Max HR: 160, Average HR 82, Ventricular ectopic activity consisted of seven beats, of which six were single PVCs and one was a single VE. Supraventricular ectopic activity consisted of 210 beats, of which 10 were in atrial couplets, 125 were late beats, 75 were single PACs. The longest R-R interval was 1.4 seconds. The longest N-N interval was 1.4 seconds. I have also done an overnight pulse oximetry test which came back as normal. I have also tried Metoprolol ER and nonextended release. I was only able to take it for a week as the results fixed the racing and weird beats, but after about an hour I was barely able to walk to my bed and fell asleep for 10 hours without my husband being able to wake me up no matter how hard he tried.\u00a0 The palpitations seem to be getting less frequent (especially since the pain from the cyst removed earlier in the year has subsided), but then I will have a week where I get them every day, a few times a day for about 20-minute increments. My husband wants me to get a 30-day heart monitor, but after working with my current cardiologist's office, we have been unable to get one after two and a half months of them saying they are sending it. My husband now wants me to go to a different cardiologist\u2019s office, but the closest one is over three hours away. So, I wanted to get a different cardiologists opinion. Is there anything that I really need to worry about or is my heart relatively normal and this is just a case of something that I have just never experienced before? Should I continue to push to get the 30-day Holter monitor or get a new cardiologist and make the trip? Doctor: Hello. I went through your reports. Regards.

There is no harm in marrying a girl with the same blood group as you. Everyone is born with a certain blood type that is either Rh positive or Rh negative. Rh-positive blood is more common than Rh-negative. There is no problem if you marry a partner with the same blood type/grouping as yourself. When looking at a blood type, it is not the letter you should be concerned about, but the Rh factor (the positive or negative sign after your blood type letter, example: O + or O -). A woman is at risk when she has a negative Rh factor (example: O-) and her partner has a positive Rh factor (example: O +). This combination can produce a child who is Rh positive. While the mother's and baby's blood systems are separate there are times when the blood from the baby can enter into the mother's system. This can cause the mother to create antibodies against the Rh factor, thus treating an Rh-positive baby like an intruder in her body. If this happens the mother is said to be sensitized. A sensitized mother's body will make antibodies. These antibodies will then attack an Rh-positive baby's blood, causing it to break down the red blood cells of the baby and anemia will develop. In severe cases, this hemolytic disease can cause illness, brain damage, and even death. If you have more questions feel free to ask.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Allergy is due to some component in the air that she breathes. We must identify what she is allergic to. Some of the following you may need to do. 1. After using the Duonase spray for 15 days as given by your doctor, change it to Mometasone and use it once daily. Two puffs in each nostril for 30 days and thereafter one puff each nostril. There is a particular way to use spray. If you do not know that then revert back. 2. Continue the Montair LC syrup for a couple of weeks and keep using it on an SOS basis whenever she gets allergy. When you start, continue it for a day. A single daily dosage is sufficient usually. 3. Inhalers like Asthalin and Seroflo are to be used as per the chest physician advice. Keep both handy and may need to be used whenever there are flare-ups. 4. Maintain a diary and write down whenever she gets allergic symptoms, when she goes to some new place, when she opens any old book, garden, pollen, any relation to the food she eats, linens, beddings, etc. 5.

Tonsils are our lymphoid organs which protect us from infections. The shape of tonsil can vary from person to person and asymmetrical shapes are not at all indicators for cancer. The holes you mentioned are called crypts which lodges food particles which can form stones. Hence, regular salt water gargling is advised.

Hence you need not to worry thinking abnormal shapes of tonsil for cancer which is pretty much normal in all individual.

The correct type for your mother can be decided by her treating doctor based on various factors like age, weight, her daily routine, previous medical history, etc. Please talk to your doctor and see if Insulin is an option for her. If she prefers to take oral medication only, she might have to wait until the medicine shows its action. I hope that answers your question."

Is this BP good enough for my age? Any suggestions, please? Doctor: Hello. Diastolic BP is fine, but systolic is mildly elevated. According to recent evidences and guidelines, lower is better. If BP is persistently elevated above 140, then it is better to add some other medicines to keep it atleast below 140 consistently and preferably below 130 systolic. We are not much concerned about diastolic BP even if goes lower. Since pulse rate is 60, then Concor dose may be increased to 7.5 or 10, but cautiously monitoring pulse rate. Instead better option is to add another medicines like Losartan 25 mg or Chlorthalidone 25 mg. Should also have low salt diet and regular exercises. So, overall, we should target BP a bit lower."

As you told that your childhood period was full of lots of bad issues and nowadays you are not able to recall those old memories, so it is somewhat good that your mind itself is supporting you to get apart from your bad memories.

But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods? Doctor: Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

At first, my thumb was swollen and redness was present. I could not bend it at all. After using R.I.C.E, the swelling has decreased to near normal and it is much more flexible. There is still some pain on the index finger side of the joint when pressed, but grip strength is returning. I am now able to straighten the thumb without difficulty but I cannot fully close the thumb on itself. What should be my next course of action - more rest, work on stretching it out or consulting a specialist? Doctor: Hi. Your description of pain, the presence of swelling and redness and its site of maximum tenderness makes me worry about what is called the \"gamekeepers thumb\". This is the injury of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of the thumb. If that is the injury then you should ideally have yourself examined by a doctor to assess the degree of the injury of the ligament. Because a complete tear will require surgery. But from your description, the chances are remote as you have regained movements and the pain is also settling. The main issue with the UCL injury is lack of or weakness in the pinch grip between the thumb and the index finger which can be quite troublesome for people who do heavy work with their hands.

The morning after pill or emergency contraceptive has to be taken within 72 hours in the proper dosage as recommended to avoid pregnancy. Emergency contraceptive affects the menstrual cycle, prevent ovulation, fertilization, and implantation differ in different types of contraceptives. If taken within 72 hours in proper advised dosage, you will get the withdrawal bleed within 1 to 2 weeks maximum instead of your regular menstrual period bleeding. Scheduled menstrual bleeding could be disturbed due to externally induced hormones. As body get rid of hormonal effect, gradually periods take a previous pace for menstrual bleeding or period bleeding as was before taking I-pill, depends on the body's response. Less chances of pregnancy if taken properly in proper dose within 72 hours with no history of vomitings of medication or I-pill."

Can you suggest me the tablets which work best as I have to give presentation after some days in my class. Please help. Doctor: Hello. You are reporting a relapse of some social anxiety symptoms after discontinuation of Paroxetine SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) medication. Depending on the extent of your social anxiety symptoms, you have two options: 1) If anxiety is predominantly situational (like giving a presentation in a class and other social interactions), then just taking Inderal (Propranolol) 40 mg once daily as needed should be helpful. Check with your doctor about not having any contra-indications before taking propranolol. 2) If anxiety is pervasive and not allowing you to function normally, you can try other SSRI like Sertraline. SSRIs are one of the safest medications to manage long term anxiety. Did you have any CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) for managing social anxiety? They are very effective. CBT will lessen the need for medication and will help to prevent relapse. Consult a psychologist in your city for CBT. You can also try deep breathing techniques and progressive muscle relaxation exercise daily."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it?

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill.

I do not have any erectile dysfunction. But still I am not able to enjoy sex due to this problem. Is there any medication to enhance sensation? Please help me overcome this problem. Doctor: Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. Having less or no sensation in penis while having sex is generally due to local factors. The systemic illnesses rarely affect in this way. Masturbation is normal and it does not have any adverse effects either on sensation or erection. So it is time to realize that the sensation problem is not due to chronic masturbation. The possible reason as per available history is dryness of penis which makes the nerve endings non-functional over a course of time. To counter this problem it is essential to use oil based soap (rather than traditional soap) and skin moisturizer which prevent the dryness of skin of glans penis. It can be said that you can use any branded moisturizer for application to penis and local area after taking bath every day. During love making session I advise you to use Durex real feel which is available across the globe for increasing sensation and making the sex more pleasurable. Unfortunately there are no medicines for this purpose and lubricants which I have mentioned above will be helpful to a large extent.

Pain in testes can be due to infection of testes is called orchitis. Or occasionally lifting heavy weight can cause torsion in testes that are emergency condition and has severe pain.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My father recently had a heart attack and a stroke. Then had two heart valves repaired and they want to put a stent in. His list of medications does not seem to make sense and although he loves his cardiologist. I do not think he is paying enough attention. I am in the medical field and although I am not a pharmacist or an M.D. I know a little bit about adverse drug reactions. Tell me if this makes sense to you. Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg half pill twice a day, Potassium Chloride 20 mEq once daily, Losartan potassium 25 mg once daily, Warfarin sodium 5 mg once daily, Atorvastatin 20 mg, Digozin 25 mcg once daily and Furosemide 40 mg once daily. I need to know if these medications are fine to take all in one day and if so, I would like to split them into two times a day according to the reactions. I feel that so many medications doing the same thing is redundant and unnecessary and causing problems. Please help me. Doctor: Hi. Let us evaluate all medications your father is receiving. Diagnosis: Valvotomy, CAD with MI (coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction) and CVA (cerebrovascular accident) (recovered). Tablet Metoprolol is essential in patients with heart attacks as it slows the heart and keeps it healthy. So we cannot omit that. The dose is already very low and so we cannot reduce it further. Tablet Losartan, again essential in people with heart attacks. It is a disease-modifying drug. The dose is already less and cannot be reduced. But yes, the timing can be changed to alternate with Metoprolol (one in the morning and one in the evening). The danger is giving Potassium tablet Losartan and Digoxin and can cause increased potassium levels and giving more potassium is highly dangerous. The doctor might have given for some time but it has to be stopped now. Warfarin is given for stroke prevention. 5 mg is a minimal dose. It cannot be removed as stroke prevention is essential. Timing can be made flexible. Atorvastatin is for heart attack prevention. Ideally can be taken at bedtime. Frusemide is a diuretic. There is no specific reason to give this in your case. The only issue I can think of is because of the valve surgeries they want to keep blood volume low. This can be discussed and removed. Ideally can be given in the morning. About Aspirin, it should not be given when you are giving Warfarin. Remove it if it is still on. If the blood becomes very thin then there are chances of brain hemorrhages. I hope this helps."

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, It has been six months of my marriage and I am getting so much heartbroken and emotionally weak. Since the first day of my marriage, my husband has some or the other issue like trust, with the clothes, my siblings, and my friends. He hardly cares for me, no love is there between us. Over it, my in-laws are also very much interfering. At this point, I do not know what should I do. Because with such circumstances it is not possible for me to be in this relationship. But somewhere I feel can the circumstances change? Please help. Doctor: Hi. I completely understand that you feel disturbed due to your partner-related problems. Every girl faces challenges at the start of marital life. For some girls, it may be difficult to adjust with the new partner/ family. Some of them get adjusted after spending time with in-laws and understanding them.  Major problems that arise between couples are due to communication problems e.g., not discussing the issues directly with the partner, assuming that your partner must be thinking like this, lack of communication/not talking about the problems or ignoring them. This may lead to 3rd party involvement such as in-laws start interfering because they see partners are unable to resolve their issues. Detail about the kind of trust and other issues you are facing with the partner. Insufficient information to diagnose. I suggest you some of the strategies which may help you and your partner resolve the marital issues.  Take couple counseling from a psychologist and learn effective communication skills to sort out daily life issues.  Directly communicate the problems with your partner before discussing it with any third person.  Share your real feelings with your partner such as how much you feel concerned about your relationship, how much you love or care about your partner, etc.  If communicating any negative feeling e.g., anger, hurt feelings, focus on your tone of voice and body language. A polite talk with the next person can resolve many problems even you communicate your negative feeling, but the key is your polite and low tone and saying words which are similar to your internal or real state. E.g. if you are saying to your partner I love you and saying it with grimaces and loud voice this is not going to communicate your real feelings and the next person will believe in your body language, not the words, which will definitely leave a negative message. In this scenario, if you are trying to resolve the problem by crying or shouting, this will even worsen the problem instead of doing something positive to your relationship.  Tell him that you feel to resolve the issues, and wonder if your circumstances can change.  Think about something positive in your relationship and tell your partner. For instance, praise his good qualities and anything you like in your partner.  Spend time with your partner talking about each other and planning something that you both enjoy. It can be an outing, working together on home chores, laughing/talking together, making love, or anything which you both prefer to do.  As you spend time, figure out the reasons for disagreement or conflicts between you and partner. Start working on the issues to resolve the problems. Remember, problems are a part of life, so every time you face a problem, just apply a problem-solving approach.  Apply above mentioned tips and techniques. If you face difficulty or further need assistance, you both can directly go to a psychologist office and ask for couple counseling. You are recommended to work on your relationship or start proper treatment as soon as possible. Delay in treatment often results in worsening of relationship and the consequences may be negative. I hope this information is helpful to you. Do take follow-up if you feel the need.  Best Regards,"

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, Due to an accident, I had unsafe sex. I went to the pharmacy to get a EPC or morning-after pill. However they said they were not being sold. They prescribed Althea cypriterone acetate ethinyl estradiol (2 mg / 35mcg tablet) from Trust and said to take 1 per day for the next 21 days. However if I understand correctly: Is this a normal contraceptive? I read some things about the yuzpe method, how would this work with the contraception described? And I already took one pill an hour ago. What should I do? I do not want to get pregnant. Especially since this is the 13th day since my menstruation, I am getting worried. Doctor: Hi. You should get emergency pills if they are selling normal contraceptive pills. Anyway in emergency pills the dose of hormones are more. So you can take 4 tablets two times a day for 2 dose. Can also works same as emergency pills. But at the same time you should understand that emergency pills are not 100 % safe and there is up to 30% chance of failure. But have only option after unprotected sex. When you stop taking tablets than there can be withdrawal bleeding within 7 days. And your cycle can be irregular for 1 or 2 periods if you are not pregnant. Best way to confirm whether pills worked or not is to wait for 15 days atleast and do urine pregnancy test on kit and see. If turns to be positive than you are pregnant and if negative than pills worked well. Do drink more water. Chance of failure is because pills worked by stopping ovulation but if ovulation already happened than it will not work. So have to wait and watch after taking pills."

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem.

Extreme irritability, anxiety and tremors. And extreme trouble breathing as well as dementia-like symptoms. My question is if I have been ingesting small amounts of Strychnine are there any tests that will show it? Will small amounts of Strychnine build up in my hair follicles? Will any signs of it remain in my blood? How long after ingestion will traces still be detectable? And what is the best method of determining whether or not it is, in fact, Strychnine that I have been ingesting? What kind of symptoms can I expect after long term exposure? Are the symptoms likely to continue after I am no longer exposed? And am I likely to recover? Doctor: Hello. What is your age? Since how long have you been ingesting Strychnine? In what form and amount? Though there are one such diagnostic tests available to detect Strychnine poisoning other than typical signs and symptoms like generalized effect of muscles, convulsions, etc. Chemical analysis can be done to reveal the poison.  Yes, continuos use of Strychnine can deposit in the body and can be detected many years after death as well, but not in hair follicles but in the spinal cord. Some amount of Strychnine also gets secreted in milk, saliva, sweat, etc. To know whether it is Strychnine apart from test typical signs and symptoms will conform it. Presence in the body and detection of the same would depend largely on the form of poison consumed. The presence of symptoms must be treated with certain drugs. Long term exposure will cause it to accumulate in the body. I hope this helps."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, My son is 2.5 years old. For a week, he is complaining of stomach pain. After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you. Doctor: Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience. Child will eat properly now as he has recovered from illness."

Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/dermatologist"

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I took oral antifungal on GP prescription, but nothing changed. Now for the wierd part. I work as a PhD student in preclinical oncology. I often work with mice and I realized that some of the mice I came in contact with were developing red spots. The only difference is that while my spots are slightly swallowed, on the mice they are deep like the outer layer of the skin is missing. The vet said they are not in pain. They seem not to spread the disease (e.g. 6 mice per cage, only 1 with symptoms for several months). This happens only on mice I came in contact with. The spots on mice extend with time up to 20% of the skin surface (for what we observed), but causing no mortality. The mice used here are NMRI nude mice lacking T-linfocytes. I think an atypical dermatitis is not contagious, so how could it be? Could my diagnosis be wrong or are the spots on the mice an uncorrelated thing? Than you in advance for any help! Doctor: hi the type of description of your reasons it appears that you are having hives or urticaria. it is a slightly raised red or white lesion which occur on the skin and disappear on its on after few minutes or hours this occur due to allergy to some internal or external agent that maybe water, in case of aquagenic urticaria. had you included a photo I would have helped you more. as far as the lesion in mice are concerned you are saying that outer layer of the skin has gone so it actually appears to be type of skin like necrosis . and in your case there is no such lesion, a typical dermatitis as diagnosed by GP is vague term and general term sometime used when you cannot reach a specific diagnosis. please send a photo if it is due to water note that whenever you touch water to some part of the skin it happens or not. take fexofenadine 120 MG once daily for a week and then tell me how much response you have, you can also take it as per need like alternate day for every 3rd or 4th day. do lot of oiling of the skin, dont use Harsh soaps and avoid any irritant application thankyou"

Doctor: Hello. I have read your concern. You might be worried of the cerebral edema if this will cause any harm. A repeat 48 hour CT scan if with any signs of wakefulness deterioration is warranted if that ever happens. The blood clots is a sequelae of the trauma to the face. Most commonly this is part of the superficial veins near the nostrils called keisselbachs plexus. This will heal. Give it 2 to 3 days until it gets crusted by itself with the help of the antibiotics to lessen chances of infection. If the CT scan is normal other than the mild cerebral edema is seen, then no further medical and neurosurgical procedure is needed. The zygoma fracture and orbital fracture is also not worrisome if does not cause any deformity (like a protruding bone), and does not need any procedure for it if it does not obstruct your visual field or puncture the globe of the eye. I agree with antibiotics and saline spray three times a day. It would also help taking some Ibuprofen to lessen the inflammation and swelling, if taken every eight hours."

It resolves automatically or uses tablet Cetirizine. Third, black tongue, not sure by pictures, if any, can be due to Nevirapine, which can give that and please specify the drug in PEP.

I am worried that my hormones are out of balance. Doctor: Hello. The presence of pinkish-brown spotting in the proliferative phase of your cycle does indicate that you are having inadequate endometrialization possibly due to decreased serum estradiol levels during the phase. Also if the spotting turns darkish brown in the second phase of the cycle, then the level of progesterone is also inadequate which can cause early spotting premises as well. It is suggested that you should get your hormonal profile for day-2 of cycle done and also take to sequential ultrasonographic follicular and endometrial thickness monitoring which would indicate the state of endometrialization due to estrogens and also the correct time of ovulation. This can be corrected by starting estradiol pills in the first half of the cycle followed by progesterone-only pills post ovulation, which shall prevent these bleeding episodes."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

It has been going on and off for about five hours. Doctor: Hi. I understand your concerns. Your symptoms are most likely due to heart arrhythmia most likely AFib (atrial fibrillation), the most common arrhythmia which causes palpitations and may be completely asymptomatic. The other possible causes include SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) or other heart arrhythmias. Please provide me with more details in order to reach the appropriate diagnosis. Is it the first time you have this symptom? Do you have any health problem (thyroid or heart)? My advice is to perform ECG (electrocardiography) and send me the report. Measure your blood pressure.

I went for a sonar as I did two pregnancy test and both show faint lines but still got my monthly cycle as it was not the same it was watery at first and very little the second day. It was heavy but still light and lasted only three days. I was late by two weeks this month. The sonar showed an oval almost water drop like dark line and the doctor said he does not know what it is. It is above the pregnancy line. The way he described it could I be pregnant? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Let me start by giving you a few basic facts about fertility and pregnancy. When blood levels of Beta hCG hormone (the pregnancy hormone) are above 25 miu/ml urine test becomes positive, that is you get two lines. If it was faint, maybe the levels were just above 25. You can see a pregnancy on scan only when the levels of beta hCG is above 1500 miu/ ml. So what you saw on scan might mostly be a thickness in endometrial lining. From your history, I presume the pregnancy was not strong enough or healthy enough to survive, so you had your period. No matter how the daily bleeding was. If you still want a confirmation, have a serum beta hCG tested today, it will give you a baseline value. Then repeat it after 48 hours, that is two days. If it is a healthy pregnancy, it will double or else it will be the same or fall if an unhealthy pregnancy. Do not worry about the scan, it is too early to see anything on the scan.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

Your back muscle gets relaxed at night. So you do not have the pain at night. Sitting for long hours can aggravate back pain. Poor posture while sitting can also lead to back pain. Do back extension exercise, and sit only for 25 to 30 minutes on the chair. Sit in a chair which is having lumbar support. Take NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for a few days."

We have to rule out any organic lesion in the nose as that can cause difficulty in breathing through the nose. The deviated nasal septum, polyp (edematous mucosa), etc., can be a possibility. I suggest you rhinoscopy nose examination first to rule out above lesion. The second possibility could be inflammation in nasal mucosa leading to enlarged turbinate which causes difficulty in breathing through the nose. You can take Levocetirizine 5 mg once a day for a week. Take one teaspoon turmeric powder with milk daily. Steam inhalation with warm water three times a day can be beneficial.

Now the two streams happen 30% of the time and if I pinch my penis it goes back together. But sometimes not. I have seen it come together midstream and go apart midstream. Doctors here feel the double stream is linked to pressure on the bladder, from anxiety. What do you think? Doctor: Hi. The split stream can be due to narrowing of the urethral opening or sometimes due to voiding with high pressure. If you consult your urologist, get a uroflow test done. If there is any narrowing, it will show in the flow. Splaying of the stream can sometimes be prevented by pissing with foreskin fully down (non-retracted) provided you are not circumcised. Also, if frequency and urgency are problematic, add an anticholinergic. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take medications with their consent.

But he has great eye contact, responds to name, asks for help with something, babbling, says words like nah, dada, nana for banana, he will point to banana in the book and say it. That to me is pretty smart for a 15-month-old. Imitates, for example, claps hands understands when I say something like, hey Siri he looks straight at the phone. Waves bye we do not even face to say goodbye just I am going or when dad leaves for work and he waves. Loves cuddles sometimes he will gnaw in my arms and make noises. Do not know if that is just a soothing thing he does. We went to playgroup yesterday and looked at what others were doing smiling and laughing. Walked by 14 months. Follows others if they go somewhere, he will open his books and sound out what they are and looks at me as he does it. I know these all sound like a normal developed child, but I am just worried he will not outgrow what he is doing and later develop it. Am I worrying for nothing I just wanted to get your thoughts. Doctor: Hi. Please note that whatever you have described is a sign of a normal growing child. It is not a sign of autism. These are signs of the child grasping the knowledge of the things and interacting with things around him. Please do not worry. Also, I would advise tender loving care to your child. Spend more time with the child and interact more often with him. Your child should be fine if your interaction with him is fine. Find age-appropriate toys and games for him. It will improve his intellect. One thing I would advise is to prevent giving your phone or for that matter any phone to the growing child. Handing over a mobile phone to any child cancels all human interaction. The child could have as the child would be lost in the neverending world of the cell phone and not even realize it.

Recently, I have taken Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin along with my usual medicine like topical corticosteroid, Sertraline, Montelukast and Rosuvastatin. Is taking these medicine like Hydroxychloroquine do any harm? Or do I need any adjustments with my regular medicine? Doctor: Hello. I am sure some healthcare providers must have advised you to take these drugs and he would be aware of these interactions before starting. If you are self-medicating yourselves I would strongly advise you against that. Using Hydroxychloroquine together with Sertraline can increase the risk of an irregular heart rhythm that may be serious and potentially life-threatening, although it is a rare side effect. You may be more susceptible if you have a heart condition called congenital long QT syndrome, other cardiac diseases, conduction abnormalities, or electrolyte disturbances (for example, magnesium or potassium loss due to severe or prolonged diarrhea). Your doctor may already be aware of the risks but has determined that this is the best course of treatment for you and has taken appropriate precautions and is monitoring you closely for any potential complications. You should seek immediate medical attention if you develop sudden dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, shortness of breath, or heart palpitations during treatment with these medications, whether together or alone. With Rosuvastatin, the risk of peripheral neuropathy may be increased during concurrent use of two or more agents that are associated with this adverse effect. Patient risk factors include diabetes and age older than 60 years. In some cases, the neuropathy may progress or become irreversible despite discontinuation of the medications. It does not have any interactions with topical corticosteroids and Montelukast."

I started treatment in India and took Cipralex, and Escitalopram. CT scan was normal. My symptoms relieved for about 80-90%. I gradually tapered off the treatment. Later, mild dreamy sleep problem with mild and sound sensitivity occurs. I did not took any medicine for that. I also suffered from scalp pain in head and treated for three months with Phenergan, and Neocalm plus. I felt only temporary relief. MRI was done in consultation with neurologist. Results are normal. I was on Cipralex 10 mg, Naproxen sodium 250 mg then gradually tapered. After that I am suffering from dreamy sleep all day and localized head pain episodes 2-3 times in a week when sleep disturbed in the previous night. Meanwhile, I was heavily stressed due to family issues and job pressure. Once again I was prescribed the same medicines but I did not take and tried to control it with yoga and meditation. I have mild light and sound sensitivity which is quite tolerable. My major problem is disturbed dreamy sleep and episodes of localized head pain in the scalp only. I took vitamin D, B12, calcium for six months. My elevated triglycerides are due to SSRI 230 mg/dl. At present, I am alright but want to get rid of symptoms. My symptoms are muscle tension and nerve pain. I did eyes test OCT and my eyes are normal. My questions are even if I am not stressed I do not get dreamless and refreshing sleep why? Which is suitable medicine in general? Can Flunarizine cause more deficiency of calcium as already I am deficient? Cipralex and Esclitopram are habit forming but I was very comfortable with that it causes weight gain and elevation of triglycerides so I tapered off to end. But after some time dreamy sleep and scalp mild pain comes back. What to do? Kindly suggest and advise some medicines. Doctor: Hello. Your symptoms seem to be related to tension type headache, which is a benign headache. Light and sound intolerance are features of migraine, but the other symptoms you explain, are more compatible with tension type headache. Nevertheless, I agree with your doctor treatment regarding Escitalopram. You should know that the sleep disorders are related to different causes depression, daily stress and anxiety, vitamin D deficiency, an abnormal sleep regime, caffeine intake, etc. I would recommend taking Vitamin D if there is low plasma levels of this vitamin. Regarding your sleep disorder, I would recommend starting Zolpidem for a couple of weeks 10 mg before sleep. You can try half a tablet before going to 10 mg. Melatonine intake can regulate your sleep rhythms too, but it is taken for a more prolonged time than Zolpidem and its effects are lower. A good sleeping hygiene (sleep always at the same time, avoid straining physical or emotional activities before sleep, avoid caffeine intake) would help too. If all these tips and drugs are not helpful, a prolonged brain EEG (electroencephalogram) during sleep would help diagnose any possible sleeping disorders. Regarding Flunarizine, I would explain that this is a calcium channel blocker and as such it can interact with calcium or vitamin D in high amounts. But usually it does not affect the calcium levels. You can try taking Escitalopram for three months initially and then try Flunarizine, if no good results on Escitalopram. I would not recommend taking them both initially. You should know that Escitalopram achieves its effect after three weeks from the starting, and the main changes to be seen are a reduce in the frequency of headaches and also mood changes (optimism). You can try taking Amitriptyline too, if you do not have any symptoms relief after the first month on Escitalopram. It can be really helpful with the sleep too. All the drugs have some adverse effects, but the benefits are higher. I hope this helps."

It started about one and a half months ago as a normal flu with coughing and runny nose. I took some flu medicines (Lemsips pills), I got rid of the runny nose, but I still had the cough which was dry. After a few weeks the cough began to be productive and the pharmacist prescribed some cough syrup (Robitussin) and Paracetamol. After a blocked ear, due to inflammation, I had to take antibiotics as well (Amoxicillin). Now I only cough in the morning, but I have this chest pain, mostly when I lie down. I do not have any other symptoms such as fever, runny nose, etc. Doctor: Hi. It seems like a little infection in lungs maybe. So I am prescribing some drugs and tests as well. Take medicines properly and do the test and show me. 1. CBC (complete blood test). 2. Pulmonary function test. 3. Chest x-ray. Take syrup Dextromethorphan two times daily, Amoxiclav 625 mg (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) three times daily for five days, Diclofenac and Paracetamol two times daily for three days, and Levocetirizine 5 mg once daily for five days.

Doctor: Hi. It is really great that you want to know about an important issue and just do not want to make assumptions on your own. STIs are the diseases that are typically transmitted during sexual intercourse. It is unlikely to catch sexually transmitted infections with kissing alone, but with a few exceptions if the STI has manifested itself orally and/or in oral fluid of that person. Hepatitis B virus can be transmitted through kissing as the virus is found in saliva and other body secretions of HBV infected person. Herpes infection- This can be transmitted through kissing with a person who has a visible cold sore. Human papillomavirus (HPV) or warts and syphilis are less likely to be transmitted through kissing. So far, there is no reported case of HIV transmission through kissing."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I still had sore in the same spot and was worried about my artery and my lymph node. Could my lymph node be painful because they adjusted my neck or because my muscle was sore and irritated? Doctor: Hello. I do not think that because of chiropractor there will be any trouble to the lymph node. If the pain is radiating in nature, then it can be related to intervertebral disc injury which can be a past injury and due to which you had a sore neck. As the intervertebral discs are located in between the two vertebral bodies and the muscles are the supporting structures any trouble to the disc can first make the muscle sore and change the normal curvature of the cervical spine. The radiating symptoms can arise due to nerve root entrapment by the muscle as well as the intervertebral disc. Having an MRI scan of the cervical spine will be useful to avoid further injuries. Also, doing hot water fermentation will help to reduce the muscle spasm of the cervical spine region and the trapezius muscle by which the normal alignment of the cervical spine is achieved. Using cervical soft collar will help to reduce the mobility of the cervical spine leading to stabilization of the joints and less nerve root entrapment. Exercises like static neck exercises, shoulder stabilization exercises, interscapular muscle strengthening exercises will help to regain the muscle strength and correct the cervical spine alignment. If you have any more questions, you can ask me anytime."

I am under huge stress, I need your help. Doctor: Hello. Going by your description, it seems highly unlikely that you have contracted HIV infection. The ELISA (enzyme-linked immuno0sorbent assay) detects antibodies to HIV antigens whereas the combi test detects both antibodies and antigen. Since you have done these tests much after the exposure, I believe there is a little chance that you could be harboring HIV infection. The rashes you have developed are more likely to be a part of Crohn's disease syndrome progression. Humira, although may suppress the production of antibodies, it does not affect the detection of HIV antigen. Crohn's disease has various non-intestinal manifestations that could crop up anytime.

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it?

She was extremely pleased with the way the doctor conducted the investigation. He was very quick to respond and did a commendable job. No serious issues were observed in the MRI scan. Today my mother got another MRI scan done, both with and without contrast medium. Can you please read this MRI scan and also let me know if there is any sign of cancer in the neck area. I have attached my mother's MRI reports for your reference. Kindly have a look and guide me. Thank you in advance. Doctor: Hi. I had a detailed look at the contrast images of your mother (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There appears to be light gray to black areas seen in the central portion of T1 and the left side of T2 vertebral bodies. These findings were not clearly seen in the previous scan. There was even a vague appearance seen in a small portion of the C7 vertebra on the right side of the body, but nothing abnormal as such. After a thorough examination of the contrast pictures of MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), I observed, that the contrast sequences do not highlight the lesion, just the way it should in case of a tumor or cancerous area present. It seems to be due to marrow changes. According to my knowledge, on T2 sequence, it happens to be non specific, benign signal abnormalities seen in more than one vertebra which may not cause severe pain on the left side of neck. I would like to suggest you to get another MRI scan in a period of three to six months time."

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Could you explain a little more about what this collection of cells is called and the healing process from this? Doctor: Hello. Whatever mineral oil or any oil you instill, will only act outside the eardrum. The cells that are outside the eardrum form cerumen or wax and these oils will be helpful. I can give you the dose and duration for that. But however, if there was fluid inside the ear, now resolved, the ringing should be due to that. The fluid we are talking about is the one inside the drum. In a scenario where the drum is intact, these oils are of no use to remove the cells which have got clumped inside the drum.

A fever has multiple causes, the most common causes are viral fever, throat inflammation. Usually, these illness does not require antibiotics (Amoxicillin). Antibiotics should be started only in a bacterial infection that too after doctor's recommendation. For high great fever (100 F or more ), you can give Meftal P 3 ml stat dose and repeat after six hours. If the fever is more than 100 F. If fever is less than 100 F then continue P 250 4 to 6 hourly. In between medication do whole body tepid sponging. The purpose is to get down fever as early as possible to normal temperature. If fever is not subsiding after 48 to 72 hours, then you need to investigate and show to doctors to rule other important causes of fever. Tepid sponging can be done with a wet towel, starting from head to toe. Check temperature after it, if it gets down stop tepid sponging."

Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run.

After careful review, I can appreciate well the sensitivity of the issues you and your family is suffering from. Your father seems to have left heart failure (attachment removed to protect patient identity) that landed him twice in the hospital. He is having the valve issues, especially the mitral valve and all the related symptoms of abdominal swelling, breathing issues and leg swelling are due to failure of the heart to pump normally. In such a case we need to go for thorough evaluation in cardiac care hospital. Try to search locally for a better heart hospital where better diagnostic test facilities available. My recommended lifestyle modifications for your father include smoking cessation, restriction of alcohol consumption and salt restriction. He is having this issue because heart muscles are unable to get their blood supply in a proper way. More specific testing like angiography may be needed for the diagnosis of the issue. As far as the permanent management plan is concerned, it is difficult to say anything about that before assessing the heart's own blood vessels through angiography.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

      "tgt": "How to prevent sinus infection?",
      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am writing this on behalf of my wife. She is 26 years old. The problem is that she is prone to sinusitis. She gets infected with sinusitis at least once in two months. When she gets infected, it takes one to two weeks to recover. Her nasal passages gets blocked and she finds it difficult to breath through the nose. Also, the mucus is very thick and she tries very hard to squeeze the mucus out. Sometimes, she applies too much pressure and finds blood stains in the mucus. She tried vaporizer and saline spray, but none of them seems to work for her. She also gets a severe headache at times due to the mucus getting blocked. She feels a pain around her eyes too. Due to this she remains inactive during the entire period. The assumption is that most of the time, she gets infected due to exposure to dust or cold climate. Is there a permanent solution for this problem? Is there anything that she can do to prevent the infection? Please help. Doctor: Hi. She may have an allergy and a superadded bacterial infection. If she is getting recurrent infection, then get a skin prick allergy test and CT scan of the sinuses. The CT scan may show either mucosal thickening or polyp or a deviated septum, which may block the drainage of the sinuses. If positive findings on CT scan, then she may need endoscopic sinus surgery. If the sinuses are normal, then she will improve with antibiotic, anti-allergy tablet and steroid nasal spray. Skin prick allergy test and CT scan sinuses. I suggest the following treatment for sinusitis. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. 1. Antibiotic Augmentin 1 g (combination of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate) twice a day for five days. 2. Anti-allergic tablet Allegra 120 mg (Fexofenadine) at night for one month. 3. Use Nasonex nasal spray (Mometasone furoate) one puff at night for one month.

I would like to know if circumcision is mandatory to rectify the problem. Is there any other method which I could opt for? I am going to get married soon, and so I would like to get this problem solved. Please suggest. Doctor: Hi. Phimosis is a common problem. The simplest, long-term and permanent solution for phimosis is circumcision and is a minor day care procedure. However, if you want to try medicines you can use ointment Fludrocortisone along with Clotrimazole ointment to be applied daily for three weeks. If it does not improve, go for circumcision. Even if you get relief with ointment it is likely to be a temporary solution. Moreover, after circumcision, it is easy to maintain hygiene and there is less chance of repeat infection. After circumcision, you can resume normal activities within one or two days and sexual activity after a month. In my opinion, if indicated, go ahead with circumcision."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Looking at my computer tends to make it louder. I have special blue light blocking computer glasses. I got polarized yellow clip to use at night, in addition to three screens over my computer as well as a couple programs to warm the screen's color temperature. But, I am still experiencing elevated ringing. My audiology test revealed a slight hearing loss in left ear, but nothing that would have brought on sudden tinnitus. I am currently on Nortriptyline to aid sleep. I have an appointment to see an ophthalmologist. I am searching for any immediate help possible. Do you like to give any suggestions for a particular polarized shade for to clip on or use over my prescription specs? Doctor: Hello. From what you have described, you have tinnitus that gets exacerbated on looking at the computer screen. There is no established connection between looking at a bright object and worsening of tinnitus, though there may be isolated reports. Tinnitus is usually caused due to an inner ear problem. In my opinion, you should seek an ENT consultation instead of an eye checkup as your main problem is tinnitus. An ENT consultation will help you find out the real cause for your tinnitus.

I also try to warm the feet in warm water but there is no decrease in pain. I also took some lab tests: 1.

ESR value on my report is 12 mm/ 1st hr and the reference value for male is 0 to 10. 4. CRP high sensitive result is 0.9 mg/ dL on my report and the reference value is up to 0.6. Doctor: Hello. This is a condition in which the fascia or the tissue at the heel is inflamed, and pain is there especially in the morning after getting up from sleep. I suggest the following medications: Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. Take these tablets only if you are not allergic to them. Also, do not take these tablets if you are a known case of bronchial asthma. You need to do the following: Physical therapy. A physical therapist can instruct you in a series of exercises to stretch the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon and to strengthen lower leg muscles, which stabilize your ankle and heel. A therapist may also teach you to apply athletic taping to support the bottom of your foot.(alternatively, you can do the exercises at home too). Wear shoes which have soft soles, or alternatively, you can insert silicone heels or silicone soles. Apply ice twice daily. Doing all these things will help reduce this pain. Do X-ray of both heels - lateral view and upload it for me to see. Regards.

      "tgt": "My serum bicarbonate level is low. Is it due to respiratory alkalosis?",
      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I have been really sick from last two weeks. Two weeks ago, I had flu symptoms, like headaches, body aches, low fever, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. The chest symptoms were there straight away, and my asthma medicines (Symbicort and Ventolin) were not working from the start. I was taking 200 mg Symbicort twice daily, and Ventolin every three hours or so. After a weekend of being short of breath and tight-chested, I was on my way to my GP just to run my symptoms by him to see if I needed a GP or ER. He told me to take 12 puffs of Ventolin and go straight to the ER. The ER did ECG, chest x-ray, and blood tests. They gave me a nebulizer and Prednisone 50 mg and sent me on my way. I was still short of breath. My chest x-ray was clear, and my blood showed no infection. I did not have any improvement for the week, and I was taking Prednisone, Symbicort, and Ventolin every 2 to 3 hours. I was short of breath all week. I went to another GP, who sent me straight to the ER again. An intern took my history, after three hours of waiting with chest tightness, shortness of breath, mild intermittent sharp chest pain, and lifelong asthma, etc. I also explained that I am a non-wheezing asthmatic, and when I feel at my worst nothing can ever be heard on my chest. Interestingly, he only noted intermittent sharp chest pain not worse on deep inspiration. He did not note chest tightness when breathing. I also told them that for the 10 days, I had coughed more at night but the shortness of breath decreased overnight every night and was gone in the morning and then just gradually increased over the day until it was sober. Then the registrar came and told me that I was to be sent home, as I was taking too much medication and that was causing my heart to race, and that is why I had shortness of breath. I explained that I had shortness of breath before taking lots of medicines and that was why my physician sent me to the hospital the previous day. I did not even know that I could take it more than my usual two puffs every four hours. I was taking medicines as per my brand new asthma plan, which was given to me by my GP. I asked him \"was my heart rate high when the intern tested me?\" To this, he answered, \"I do not know, and I have not looked.\" Then he took my pulse for about three seconds with no watch and said it was 100 per minutes, but my heart rate has been tested over and over all week and was normal every time, that is why I challenged him. He then said that he would keep me in overnight for observations and to await a blood test for a blood clot. The intern had told me they would be doing an ECG and lung function tests. They put me in a room with about eight recliner chairs and no blanket. The nurse attended to everyone else in that room all night and did not even look at me once. She just ignored me. She did not even come close to me. I was awake most of the night. I could hear everything she did with the other patients. My breathing settled a little, but it was still labored all night, and I was coughing all night. They would not let me have my asthma medication. I felt hot and then cold, and I had a migraine. I felt so unwell that I could not get up to reach the button and was just waiting for her to come and help me so that I could tell her. At handover in the morning, she told the next nurse all my information loudly until she came to the bit where she whispered to him that I had been fine all night. I could not believe it. I managed to get some Panadol out of the new nurse, as he did my observation at 7 AM. Then the morning doctor, a young boy, told me he was sending me home, as I was better. I said that my shortness of breath was slowly returning with movement, as I told the doctors at night would happen. He said with asthma; I would be better off being at home as if I caught one of the nasty bugs in there things would get way worse. He said \"you do not look like you are dying, and that is my job to see if you look like you are dying. And if you do not, then you are sent home\". They never gave me an ECG, and they never gave me lung function tests. My discharge report simply stated that I should go home and take my Ventolin if severely short of breath with wheezing. They made up their minds that I was just taking too many medicines or that I had a 10-day long panic attack.\u00a0My GP asked me if I had been put on any antibiotics, and I told her how the ER said I had no infection. The GP said, but how did they know if they only took blood? She told me that the hospital tests would not show up a chest infection. So she put me on five days of Augmentin, and the headache is gone now and asthma slightly better, but I still feel tightness and short of breath. I have been sitting for an hour and a half and am breathing like I have been on a long walk. This has really scared me. The only message I got from the ER says that do not go there even if you have serious symptoms. I have been sent there by doctors. I have not been believed about my asthma all my life, as I never have a wheeze and since menopause, my asthma has gone from mild to sometimes really bad.\u00a0Home GP was worried about respiratory alkalosis, as I had been hyperventilating for 10 days. I told the intern and registrar what the GP was concerned about, and they just shrugged like it was unimportant. When I read my discharge summary, I saw my bicarbonate level is low, which indicates the possibility of respiratory alkalosis, does not it? And my eGFR level was low also, which indicates the possibility of a problem with my kidneys. The doctors told me none of this. I am being treated for low vitamin B12 and tested for anemia at the moment by my GP. I would like a second opinion as none of this is making any sense to me, and I am still pretty much just as breathless and just as tight chested when I breath. Between ER doctors and GPs, I have nowhere else to turn. I am now taking Symbicort and Ventolin. Doctor: Hello. I am sorry for your trouble.

And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

I wanted to go with a multifocal lens in my eye to avoid specs after surgery. But the doctor suggested me to go for monofocal as the eye is having infection pars planitis. Is the doctor right to choose a monofocal or should I go for a multifocal lens? Doctor: Hello. Your doctor is correct in choosing monofocal as the amount of useful vision you will get would be less and the inflammatory reaction due to pars planitis may cause you to get lesser vision post surgery than what you had before it. Another option, however, is that you can wait for around three months after your pars planitis has resolved, and when there is no residual inflammation, then it is a good option to have multi focals implemented, provided your vision potential is good.

The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling. Get an X-ray done to find out the exact problem and stronger antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) along with a painkiller for a week.

Unprotected oral sex carries negligible to low risk for HIV acquisition especially if there are fresh cuts or sores or lesions or bleeding gums. Mutual masturbation and kissing are quite safe.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I cannot eat fish, milk products, some gluten products, or chicken. My sister thinks I may have Crohn's disease. I need to find out what is going on. I have been dealing with it since I had e.coil four years ago. Doctor: Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from abdominal pain followed by defecation one hour after taking your meals. You cannot eat fish, milk, some gluten products, or chicken which can aggravate your sufferings. The most likely cause of needing to pass stool right after eating is the gastrocolic reflex. The reflex is a normal involuntary reaction to the food entering stomach. For some people, it is mild causing no symptom. For others, it may be intense and the urge to poop after eating can be severe like you. Certain health conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome or IBS can cause a person's digestive tract to move food through their system at a much faster rate. Other conditions like food allergies, food intolerances, anxiety, gastritis, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease or IBD, Crohn's disease, etc., all can give rise to digestive symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, increased frequency of defecation, diarrhea, constipation, alternating diarrhea, and constipation, etc. So you should undergo some investigations like CBC (complete blood count), USG (ultrasound) of W/A, stool culture, sigmoidoscopy, and rectal biopsy, colonoscopy, and jejunal biopsy to find out the underlying cause of your present conditions. In the meantime, you can avoid some foods like fatty or greasy foods, foods high in fiber, dairy products, etc. Again if you are suffering from anxiety, stress, or any other psychological distress, then you should take steps to remove them. After getting your investigation reports and knowing some additional history like weight loss, hormonal imbalance, previous diseases, medication history, family history I can help to treat you further. You had an e.coli infection four years back and from then you have been suffering according to your description. I think you took medication for your e.coli and e.coli usually disappears from the body with 7-14 days, but it may aggravate some rare long-lasting complications like IBS, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, etc."

Beta-hCG test is a blood test carried out that gives more confirmatory and accurate results even after home pregnancy test is found to be negative. No matter whether the results of beta-hCG is found to be positive or negative, I would recommend you to get an ultrasound of pelvis done. If the ultrasound scan shows negative result, we can rule out the possibility of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). If the ultrasound scan turns out to be positive, we can know the pregnancy details. Medicine to get periods can be prescribed if pregnancy is ruled out. 1. Beta-hCG and  2. Ultrasound of pelvis.

Last year Pap was normal but my Gyno doctor notes stated \u201cpap normal but HPV still present\u201d. I was told today that I had cleared the virus last year but why would he write HPV still present if I cleared it. Hysterectomy with removal of my cervix and uterus was done last year. Pathology of cervix and uterus were fine and normal. Last pap was 2 weeks ago. It showed abnormal cells in my vaginal cuff and HPV positive but it is not 16 or 18. The nurse told me it is a low risk type. Doctor: Hi. I understand your anxiety. The fortune thing is that even if last year HPV was present the treatment has been done in the form of hysterectomy. In fact it is over treated. I do not think it is a matter of concern.  For your vaginal HPV, low risk types are rarely responsible for any cancer. Also If one is sexually active, HPV infection keeps coming and body deals with it by its own immunity. What should concern us is a persistent HPV infection in your vaginal smears. So right now just use barrier contraception like condoms and repeat vaginal smear at 6 months. That is all. Follow up is what is needed as you are a very low risk case."

But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods? Doctor: Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/dermatologist"

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

You are right in contemplating the fact that tomorrow she will be on her day 19 of her cycle, which is her unsafe period if her menses have been regular, so chances of pregnancy with unprotected intercourse would definitely be higher. So, the best way to have protection would still be barrier contraception with condoms with additional use of spermicidal jelly over it to reduce the chances of failure due to rupture condoms during intercourse. Also, practice ejaculation outside the vagina, that would further reduce the chances of any misadventure. The second method is to ask her to use a cervical diaphragm, which is a female condom and needs to be inserted before intercourse and removed post intercourse along with you using barrier contraception. The failure rate of condoms is 3.3 percent which can be increased by either using double condoms with or without spermicidal jelly or with a female condom."

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Take the Viagra brand from the pharmacist. If you fail to get Viagra then take Penegra of Cadila. Both are good. This will have great effects. You can take Tadalafil 20 mg tablet instead of Viagra. The drug has a long duration of action and will provide sustained erection for long. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. The tablet should be taken around one hour before sex. Take plenty of water with the tablet. I hope you are not taking any antihypertensive medicines and any blood coagulants.

Upper third tooth from my right and the upper third tooth from my left.The decay in the upper right first molar appears to be deep. Depending on the symptoms, if you have acute pain that is unchanged, persistent and disturbs your sleep, then the tooth will require root canal treatment (RCT). This is because the nerve of the tooth (pulp) has been involved by the decay. If the RCT is started right away, the tooth can be saved. The decay in the upper left molar tooth is moderately deep and can be filled, if you get it done right away. If delayed, then the decay is likely to progress and involve the nerve of the tooth (pulp), then root canal treatment would be the only option to save the tooth."

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I have had pain in my right elbow and shoulder for a couple of weeks. I lift heavy weights and workout every day. I am doing this for many years, so this is nothing new. But, it is agony now to hold the bar in squats. If I am lying on the floor with the elbow at 90 degrees, I cannot put the rest of my arm on the floor. Also, wearing a sports bra, etc., hurts me and I cannot rotate my arm to try and reach my back. When I am sleeping, I tend to wake up with my arms straight out and above my head, since this is the least painful position. The last day, it is also painful to just stand with my arm straight down, feels like something is ripping across from above my sternum to my deltoid. Is there anything you can do to help this? Either exercises or stretches, which one will be helpful?\u00a0I cannot recall anything happening during a workout as that has caused this. Doctor: Hi. I am glad to respond to your query. 1. Overstraining in the gym. 2. Lifting weights that are too heavy for your shoulders and arms. 3. In the absence of the above, it may be because of insufficient healing time (rest) after a minor injury. Ultrasound shoulder would be sufficient and can get an MRI if warranted. Pectoralis major muscle strain. Ice application and rest. 1. Prevent any position of the limb that hurts your shoulder. Keep the arm supported. 2. Stop visiting the gym for at least three weeks or till the pain subsides and be regular with your medicines.

So the doctor prescribed painkillers always and when the pain was severe, the doctor also gave injections to decrease pain (one every day). After recovery in one month, I tested her blood sugar level and that came (365) nine months back, after recovering from chikungunya. Does that high level of blood sugar came due to the painkiller that she took and the injections? Followed by that I did her blood sugar test every month sometimes after 15 days then after that up to now, in last more than 1.5 year it never came up. It always came between 90 to 110 in the last 1.5 years or more time. One important point is she did not take any medicine from the date it was diagnosed. Medicine was taken only first day and not after that. She also made changes in her lifestyle as she is not taking sugar much. She is only taking natural sugar in fruits, etc. Some time brown sugar in milk. Does this mean she is not having blood sugar problem and that level came up only due to painkillers and injections she took at the time of chikungunya? Is there any way I can check? Doctor: Hi. Temporarily any illness can cause elevated blood sugar levels. It is difficult to say what was the cause in her case. If the painkillers included steroids then yes, that added to the cause. But illness itself could be the reason, since it disturbs the immune system and can affect any organ system. To confirm that if she has diabetes or not, in addition to blood sugar monitoring (early morning and two hours after any meal) she will need HbA1C test specifically, that can confirm if she has diabetes or not. It is very easy to do and is available in most centers. If it is greater than 6.0 level despite diet control, she more likely has diabetes and should be treated. Acute illness. HbA1C and complete metabolic panel. To be determined after laboratory reports. Continue diet control."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Your description fits into migraine headache. Migraine headaches occur usually on one side of head and have severe throbbing sensation associated. They can be accompanied with vomiting, photophobia (severe sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (fear of noise). You can see a physician who deals with migraine cases and even you can see a neurologist for the purpose. A neurological examination and fundus examination are must to rule out any other neurological problem. If required your doctor will also post you for CT scan and MRI brain. Treatment for migraine headache would be with the drugs like Flunarizine, Propranolol and Amitriptyline. In case of acute pain drugs like Sumatriptan and Ibuprofen helps to terminate the attack.

There are two possibilities in you, first is costochondritis (musculoskeletal) and the second possibility is of gastric reflux followed by fibroadenosis. Such a long duration of the pain and pain which increases on movements or pressing over the same site is usually costochondritis. Also, get your breast palpated once for any lumps (fibroadenosis), which can also cause pain if feeling pain is in the breast. You may continue Pantoprazole Domperidone combination (Pan DSR) for a week period, and if there is inadequate relief then get prescribed anti-inflammatory medicines from GP like Naproxen 250 mg twice a day along with Pantoprazole for five days.

Is there anything I can get myself over the counter that I can take or put on my skin to help so maybe I would not have anything to constantly pick at? Doctor: Hi. I am so sorry to hear about your problem, I can understand it must be really difficult for you. Anxiety has to be managed in two ways: 1. Medical management, you will require some medications if the problem is severe. I cannot prescribe them online because it needs complete evaluation and some blood test might also be required. So for that, you will have to see a local psychiatrist. 2. Therapy, psychotherapy is one of the most effective ways of controlling anxiety and depression. You need to understand the negative thought pattern which is causing the anxiety in the first place so that you can either stop them or at least not get affected by them. Cognitive behavioral therapy is one such tool. As you have mentioned, that you are not comfortable with going to a doctor which is completely understandable, I would suggest to opt for online counseling sessions which are equally effective and works well for people who either have social anxiety or have difficulty traveling. The counseling sessions are done online once a week via video consultation. Therapy and medication combined are the gold standards for the treatment of anxiety and depression. Apart from that take out some time every day and engage in some relaxing activities like deep breathing, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, etc. I can understand it is overwhelming when you have kids around and so much to do but it is important that you also take care of yourself and make yourself a priority too. Only if you are healthy you will be able to provide a healthy environment for the family. If you want to start with therapy sessions you can let me know."

How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem? Doctor: Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, Is mental health not as important as or more important than physical health? Why? What seems to be the dominant approach to treating people with depressive disorders? And, how do you think it could improve to prevent mental health crises, namely suicide? How should the topic of mental illness and more specifically depression and suicide be discussed? What role should religion or faith have in the diagnosis and treatment of depression? Is suicide morally wrong and why? How should it be portrayed in education? Doctor: Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  Sharing my thoughts based on my professional experience and expertise.  Mental Health is as important or probably even more important than physical health because most physical ailment or issue starts within the mind or if it is not for to a mental process, its tolerance and recovery depend highly on the mental state of the patient.  Depression has a biological basis of primarily disbalance of the neurotransmitter serotonin. So, first and foremost medications should be taken which is SSRI.  SSRI (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) which are a group of medications that help in increasing the level of serotonin and are first-line treatment of depression.  Therapy: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most tried and researched form of therapy which works really well for most of the patients.  Therapy and medications combined are gold standards for the treatment of depression. Suicide is one of the consequences of untreated depression. Almost 80-90 percent of people who attempt suicide have been estimated to have an underlying mental health disorder. So, one way to prevent suicide is  1. Creating awareness  2. Creating resources and trained professionals  3. Treating mental health disorders early.  Depression, suicide or any mental health issue should be discussed as often as possible and just with the same approach as any medical illness because they all essentially are biological disorders. It is important to normalize the approach which helps in reducing the stigma related to mental health. Role of faith or religion is similar to having any personal goal because they give a sense of purpose but it can be sometimes a negative influence as well because sometimes religion teaches us that our suffering is a consequence of our actions and people often are denied treatment based on this belief.  Suicide has nothing to do with morality. It is an end-stage consequence of long term suffering. It has been proven that people who attempt suicide in most cases have an underlying mental health condition that might have not been detected. It is important to address this issue and educate people as much as possible."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It needs to be clinically examined by a surgeon and if required, drained as early as possible. You need to start antibiotics too as you are diabetic which increases the chance of the infection. My antibiotic preference would be Augmentin duo (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) 1 gm twice daily for five days or Ciplox-TZ (Ciprofloxacin and Tinidazole) twice daily for five days.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Ovarian cysts are commonly known as PCOD. A cyst is a form of an immature ovum. It occurs due to hormonal imbalance, and it causes irregular menstruation. In this concern, some ayurvedic medicines taken along with yoga practices are beneficial. You need to have a regular check-up of your thyroid profile and USG abdomen. You can take the following medicines to prevent the further growth of cyst and to regulate the periods. Take Hyponid charak two tablets twice a day with warm water after meals. Take Kanchanara Guggulu (Kanchanara with Varuna) two tablets twice a day with warm water after meals. You can consume M2 tone syrup (Ashoka with Ashwagandha) 10 ml twice a day after meals. You can take Arogyavardhini Vati (Shuddha Guggulu with Shilajit) one tablet twice a day with warm water after meals. Do regular yoga like kapalbhati, Mandukasana and Ardhamatsyendrasana, Pranayama like anuloma vilom, Nadi sodhan and bhramari. These are very effective. Avoid eating spicy and fried junk foods.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore. Doctor: Hello. The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling. Get an X-ray done to find out the exact problem and stronger antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) along with a painkiller for a week.

I am HIV negative with no known STD.\u00a0I always have safe sex.\u00a0I always have very safe sex with girls who are not sex workers. But may have casual sex with others. Generally, I would imagine that they too would be practicing safe sex with their regular boyfriends, then really I do not see statistically being any real chance of contracting HIV or any other STD. I too have had casual sex with a number of such girls. If I continue these activities with multiple partners of the same profile then chance of contracting HIV or STDs should be next to zero. Is this correct?\u00a0In two situations like condom coming out or breaking, but the sex act being stopped immediately, what would be the chance of my contracting HIV or any other STD?\u00a0What other immediate preventive measure should I take if the condom breaks or comes out other than stopping the act?\u00a0Should I take Truvada immediately? If yes,\u00a0for how many days should I take it to become effective? Does it become effective from day one? Can one take it few days before sexual intercourse and stop it in between and again restart it?\u00a0Do I need to do any blood test for HIV or other STDs in case the condom breaks or slips out?

Only once in my life, around two to three years back, I had intercourse without a condom. I had myself tested for HIV six months later and it turned out to be negative. I have not had any symptoms of any STDs, but should I still get myself tested for any STDs and if so, which test should I do? Which condom size should I use? My penis is 7 inches in length and 7.5 inches in girth. Do I use XL or XXL? I do not find any condom which supports 7.5 inch girth. What should I do in this case?\u00a0It seems that if the partner is HIV+ then it would be a statistically low probability that with one sex act with protection?\u00a0Would it not be better to take Truvada regularly to be on the safer side? What are the side effects of taking Truvada regularly even if one is not at high risk?\u00a0Should I use any lubricant with the condom?\u00a0Should I get a hepatitis B shot? I am not sure whether I have had the shot earlier. Doctor: Hi. An unsafe sex increases the chance of contracting STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) as well as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). As you mentioned that the status of your partners are mostly not known, so this puts you in risk of contracting STD or HIV if you get involved in unsafe sexual practices with such partners. In case of slippage of condoms or breakage of condoms, puts you at risk, which cannot be neglected while having sexual intercourse. First and foremost important thing to do is, to stop the act and wash your genitals with mild soap under running water. Avoid applying any cream or lubricant that can cause irritation to genital skin. Besides this avoid promiscuous behavior. There is no need to take Truvada (Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate) until and unless you know the HIV status of the partner with whom you have had unprotected sex. Viral infections such as genital warts and herpes can be contracted by even skin to skin contact. For accidental genital contact, firstly get the STD profile done, and then if required start the treatment for the respective STD that is detected on testing. In your case you should use XL size condoms (extra large), which can be procured from a medical store. Having an unprotected sexual intercourse with a partner who is HIV+ then there is always a risk of contracting HIV, you cannot neglect it or can take chance of not contracting HIV by having sex only for once with such person. If you are not sure about vaccination and as you are involved in unhealthy sexual practices then you should get your hepatitis B done.

This means that no antibodies were found and that you may not be infected with HIV. Most people who become infected with HIV will develop antibodies to the virus within two months. During this time, you may have an HIV test, but this test cannot detect it. You will have to repeat the test more than three months after your possible exposure if your results are negative. Better do ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) for HIV, and VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory), TPHA (Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay), and HBsAg (surface antigen of hepatitis B virus) for STD.

Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you. Doctor: Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

How much time it will take to recover? For how many days the drain has to be installed? Doctor: Hello. I had gone through all the data you have posted. We need to know some more details about your problem. Liver abscess is mainly of two types: Bacterial and amebic. From your description as chocolate like pus, it goes more in favor of amebic etiology. So, we need to keep you on tissue agents like Metronidazole, luminal agents like Diloxanide furoate and Paromomycin for elimination of ameba from the intestine. If pus culture grows bacteria or if abscesses are multiple, then we need to provide specific coverage against the organism. Depending upon the amount of pus inside, it is normal for draining of pus like that. Time to recovery depends upon the cause of amebic versus bacterial, size of the abscess and white blood cell count. Drain needs to be continued until full drainage of the collection is done. Repeat ultrasound scan has to be performed to look for residual collection. Manipulation of the position of the drain may be needed for drainage of residual collection. Once the collection becomes dry, then the drain can be removed.

Never long-term, but I tried penis water pump and penis extenders. A few times that I used the penis extenders, the ring may have been very tightly packed around my penis while I was using it and due to the stretch it caused, and tightness, I lost circulation to my penis tip to a point the tip went numb and cold. After that, I started noticing my erections are much weaker and sensitivity has gone down significantly. Besides that, I also became very self-conscious and psychologically worried that I may have made my ED worse. I did not have problems getting an erection, but maintaining one was more difficult and my erections were softer. I stopped having sex. After three to four years, when I masturbate, the quality of the erection is much better and I am able to keep the erection but the sensitivity is not quite back. Also, my climaxes are much weaker and they do not feel as good. In the last year that I have masturbated, I have not had issues maintaining an erection when I am masturbating but I believe the sensitivity is not back. I am worried having sex, I will begin to lose the erection fast. I have red skin marks under the skin at my penis tip that is not going away. Is this due to dead cells? Have I done irreversible damage? Is there any treatment as I now am hoping to become sexually active? Many of my problems are from using the extenders and penis pump aggressively even though it was short usage and regretful decisions. Doctor: Hello. I saw the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The penis looks almost normal. As you are able to masturbate, post-marriage, sexual activity will not be an issue (rather it is better). Aggressive stretching may have caused some damage but from your description, it appears it will not affect your married life. Feeling an orgasm is also dynamic. It may become better after marriage and is unrelated to stretching. Do not worry. If after marriage there is any issue, you can consult again at that time.

Just like other surgical procedures, lasik also have a few shortcomings. I will try to explain it. Thyroid disease, in severe cases, can cause dry eyes. The severity of the problem can vary depending on the pre-operative status of the patient, and most patients require lubricant eyedrops for long periods. It is a normal phenomenon that the power of the eyes can change in women during pregnancy and lactation. So the surgery has a transient action only, and she may need to go back to glasses after childbirth. There is a possibility, and it is not seen in all women. Lasik is currently viewed as an outdated procedure due to flap-related complications. The latest method which has safe and repeatable results is the relex smile. In case, if you have the option to do smile, you can do it.

Are there any known interactions between Topamax and medical Marijuana? I use the former for treatment of anxiety and it is quite helpful, however, I have read anecdotal horror stories about combining the two. Doctor: Hello. Marijuana and Topiramate (Topamax) both increase sedation (increased sleepiness). If both are being used simultaneously, I would advice to avoid works that require constant attention and which risk the life of others (like driving, etc.). Ask your physician to modify therapy according to you, along with that your physician should monitor the therapy closely before escalating dosages."

I just want check whether my T/E2 values are proper not because I am suffering from most of the symptoms of high estrogen levels like enlarged prostate, extreme fatigue, anxiety, muscle loss, belly side fat, loss of libido, knee and joint pains, etc., for more than 10 years. Around six months back, I got checkups for gastritis, there they said it is minor gastritis only and all readings are good including thyroid, but better to check for T, e2 and PSA levels as they see enlarged prostate. Do I need to take any medicines to inhibit E2 levels like Arimidex? Please check the below readings: Testosterone 580 E2 43.6 pg/ml Prostate size 33 cc Weight 75 kg BMI 25.9 Height 172 cm Visceral fat 10.5 Body fat 27.9. Doctor: Hi. I read your query and understand your concerns. First of all, I would like to inform you that your testosterone is completely normal but not estradiol. The maximum physiological level is 40 pg/ml and the level above this rings alarm bell and should be investigated. The increased level of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) along with prostate enlargement indicates there is abnormal aromatization of sex hormones which could be due to simple overweight to sex steroid secreting tumors. Regarding the treatment, there is a definite need for treatment and Aromatase inhibitors could be the right choice for you. There are multiple options for this purpose including Arimidex. I hope this helps."

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

By the way, I have no family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, cholesterol and anything of that nature. I am a disabled military veteran and am 40% disabled as a result of being exposed to lead and asbestos during my time in service. I am drawing disability for chronic or acute sinusitis and migraine headaches. It is my contention that my heart complications are a result of being under those same conditions while in the service. I had not had any health issues nor any family history of heart issues leading up to these complications. This is a battle I have been fighting for nearly ten years. I have provided case studies, online articles and most recently, feedback from a cardiologist that stated that there has been findings that there is a correlation between lead and asbestos exposure and heart disease. Even when I was able to obtain that particular feedback, they are now requiring additional documentation. I am reaching out to you in an effort to get an open and honest opinion. The veterans administration is asking the following. Is there a greater than 50% chance that my exposure to lead and asbestos during my service time could have lead to my heart disease and heart attack? I have also included some articles below that back up the correlation between the two. Doctor: Hello. It saddens me to hear of the whole difficulties you have gone through in the past years. I must recommend you for staying strong in the face of all these difficulties. I have thoroughly gone through all your detailed explanation and here is my view. Although I have not had clinical experience of a patient with such complications, I have thoroughly researched to find enough evidence to bring me to the conclusion that lead poisoning can lead to heart diseases and stroke, but no much evidence of asbestos causing cardiovascular diseases. These below are my findings. 1. In a study that involved 60,000 participants, it was concluded that lead poisoning was associated with cardiovascular events. Most commonly but not limited to hypertension, especially in lead blood levels below 5 \u03bcg/dL. 2. Another article also detailed the complications of lead poisoning to the cardiovascular system, although the mechanism is unknown. 3. A study by the Harvard school of public health (HSPH) also detailed the effects of bone lead to increase cardiovascular complications. In my conclusion, there is more than 50% chance of a cardiovascular complication due to lead poisoning. Although they might argue the fact that only a few cases have been reported. I feel strongly that more than 50% of it caused your heart complications. Your level of lead exposure will help your case."

Since five months back I am having trouble in sleeping. These feelings of sadness, worthlessness, etc., tend to worsen at night as well. What is wrong with me? Doctor: Hi. The negative thoughts which are making you feel this way are due to depression. They are not valid thoughts, they occur due to chemical imbalance in the brain called serotonin. This is how depression works. I would suggest you to meet a psychiatrist as soon as possible and start medications. Also, I would suggest you to start counseling sessions to help you with your negative thought patterns and help you with breaking the cycle of negativity."

I wish to seek a second opinion depending upon the requirement of chemotherapy and radiation therapies and also want to know the possible side effects. Doctor: Hi. The current treatment for the early breast cancer is breast conservation surgery and sentinel lymph node (axillary node) sampling. There are oncotype testing to personalize the treatment which gives the magnitude of benefit for a particular individual. Radiotherapy is mainly given to reduce the risk of local recurrence. Side effects of radiation are skin reactions in the short term and hardening of the breast in the long term. Chemotherapy, not sure whether your mother needs chemotherapy.

The best treatment would be as follows: 1. Ask her to maintain proper oral hygiene. 2. Regular visits to the orthodontist where she can get her routine cleaning done to reduce soreness of gums. 3. The impinging metal part has to be corrected at the ulcer site by the dentist. 4. Applying Dentogel 15 gm over the ulcers thrice a day for pain relief.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Chest pain is an additional symptom that may be due to smoking and it is giving bad impact on your lungs.  3. Smoking keeps lung tissue irritated and causing inflammation and then healing. This gets repeated in your case.  4. You need to curb smoking and alcoholic beverages.  5. Consult a sleep apnea specialist for better management. If felt necessary he will advise medication or will refer you to an otorhinolarngologist for nasal defects. That may need surgical correction. Consult your doctor for prescription of : 1.

It depends on the number of pills you took and the duration of intake. If it was single or two pills, then chance of the pill affecting baby is low. Please remember that the chance can never be 0 or 100%. If exposure was continuous, which is less likely from the history you mentioned, then the pill can affect the baby.

Is it okay to continue this? Doctor: Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am a 22-year-old female. I have been having some symptoms for two years. It started with noticing some blood on the toilet paper, went to my GP and he said probably hemorrhoids nothing to worry about and then, I started having diarrhea with blood on the toilet paper again. Then I had constipation with blood in stool. I went to see a specialist that said I had a fissure. Then four months ago, I started having too much diarrhea (at least once a week) and gas and borborygmi after every single meal, no matter what I ate. I went to the specialist, I did celiac test negative and my blood tests all look fine. All my doctors said that I have nothing that it is probably stress but I am too worried. How can I convince them to give me a colonoscopy? Doctor: Hello. I have gone through your query in detail. A few details which could be helpful are, have you lost weight? Do you have anemia or any abdominal pain? Have you had a fecal calprotectin done? Apparently, your symptoms have been going on for close two years and specifically since you have had diarrhea with blood on toilet paper, it is unlikely to be due to anal fissures. Anal fissures usually are precipitated by constipation and quite unlikely with diarrhea. Persisting diarrhea and bloating is more in keeping with symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) especially since the celiac markets are negative (anyways celiac disease is unlikely to cause blood with diarrhea). On these grounds, you can certainly insist on a colonoscopy."

There is nothing to be worried about and it could be easily tackled and controlled. I would advise you to kindly get the blood tests and ultrasound and get back to me.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It includes stuff like elimination of diet, early menopause, etc. I think it may be due to something like this. I have no pain in my head, but sometimes it makes me anxious and feels sick. I also have asthma. Doctor: Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Fuzzy head or brain fog can be due to a lot of causes. Most commonly, patients present to us with a fuzzy head after improper sleep for a long time (insomnia), long term stress at the workplace, too much caffeine, or caffeinated drinks. Some medical causes can be low hemoglobin (anemia), hypotension, weakness due to improper diet, due to malabsorption, etc. We can not attribute the cause to early menopause. Early menopause is considered only when patients get menopause around 35-40 years of age. You are too young to attribute this cause to early menopause.  I will advise you to get the following tests done: 1) CBC (complete blood count). 2) BP (blood pressure) monitoring at least three values. 3) LFT (liver function test). 4) Stool routine. Once you have the reports ready, you can contact us, and we will help you. Make sure that you are not too anxious because stress will further worsen the symptoms. So try to eat well and stay healthy for the time being. Take a multivitamin supplement like Cobadex (vitamin B and C), once daily and also take tablet Evion (vitamin E)."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

She started with an odorless vaginal discharge and has reduced since but is yet to have her periods. She has no common symptoms of pregnancy but is under tremendous stress. What would you suggest? Doctor: Hello. The bleeding that she had from 26th to the 31st, post Unwanted-72 intake was the withdrawal bleed or her menses which got initiated as per the schedule of emergency pill intake. So, now her next bleeding or menses would only be after a month post 31st, that is by 2nd or 3rd next month onwards. In some cases, this may be delayed by a further one or two weeks as it is a known side effect of Unwanted-72 to delay natural menses for the next one or two cycles. So, pregnancy is unlikely as she had a withdrawal bleed. However, if you wish to confirm as well, then get a urine pregnancy test done. Regards.

The best part is that the Folic acid has no side effects. It is a water-soluble vitamin and an excess of it gets excreted in urine. So, we recommend 5 mg per day to all our patients. When sufficient dose is harmless, there is no need to take a chance by giving low doses. One more concern of mine is that you have to check with your neurologist if it is safe to go ahead with pregnancy while on Lamictal (Lamotrigine). The safety of Lamictal is not established by studies. But, if your physician has good experience with personal case series, then I think you can continue.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, Eight years ago, a car wreck shattered the windshield, and my head got injured with pieces of glass. They did not take the glass out, and I have also been dying my hair since I was 16. I developed fibromyalgia from the wreck, which is supposed to be relatively non-progressive, however as the years went by I started experiencing debilitating neck pain paired with even worse migraines. I did stretching, physical therapy, chiropractor, and even medication, but\u00a0nothing seemed to help. Last year, a pharmacy refused to refill my Tramadol. I was in such a debilitating pain that I went home and stared at where my headache was coming from, and I noticed my hair was growing funny in certain areas. So,\u00a0I started to comb close to the scalp, and the hair that where my natural color started coming out of my scalp and pain started being relieved. I also noticed that rubberized glass was coming out of so many areas in my scalp. At this point,\u00a0I could see all of the places where there was glass lodged and each time I shaved an area to get the glass out, the\u00a0pain lessened in a way I will never even forget. I went and just shaved my head. After a few months, my scalp is so itchy, flaky, scaly, and pieces of glasses are still making their way out. So, I went to see a dermatologist, who said it is seborrheic dermatitis, but I have used everything you could use for that (Clobetasol, Ketoconazole, apple cider vinegar, Prednisone, some topical cream, Salicylic acid shampoo, tar shampoo, coconut oil, etc.). But still, I have to shave my head because my scalp is still very messed up.\u00a0I think my follicles are damaged, so aside from getting injections at a dermatologist office, what treatments are available for that? Do you have a specific shampoo you recommend for repairing follicles? Doctor: Hi. The diagnosis from your history would still be seborrheic dermatitis or sebopsoriasis or scalp psoriasis. This is more of a cyclical problem, it tends to curb down with 2 to 3 months of treatment, but recurring back with a change in season or lifestyle. However, it naturally settles down as the age increases, usually around 30 to 35 years of age. The pain, as you describe, could even be neurogenic in view of a past history of trauma to the skin. This could damage the nerve fibers, which have a very slow tendency to regrow and recover, resulting in chronic pain. With regards to your scalp scaling, I would advise you to restart with a Ketoconazole, Zinc pyrithione, and coal tar combination shampoo. Initially, it would be recommended to start using it every alternate day for three weeks, with a gradual tapering in frequency. Thereafter, use it twice a week for next three weeks, and then weekly once for next three weeks along with the simultaneous introduction of your regular shampoo. In order to repair the damaged follicles, you could take oral supplements containing Biotin and Pantothenic acid, daily one tablet for a month. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicine after their consent.

Many people with dandruff have oily skin and the latest research shows that the real culprit is probably a tiny fungus called Malassezia globosa that needs oil to grow. It only becomes a problem when the fungus grows too rapidly, and our natural renewal of cells is disturbed. It causes skin cells to renew too fast and dandruff will start to show because the skin cells bond with the oil on the surface of your scalp. This process results in the formation of white flakes. Regular shampooing can even irritate your skin that may aggravate flakes formation. Do not wash your hair more than two times a week or every alternate day. Use organic shampoos without skin irritants. While washing your hair use lukewarm water. Do not use nails just massage it gently with fingers. Then wash with cold water. You may use antifungal Nizoral shampoo to control dandruff. You may use it once a week for six to eight weeks. If symptoms still persist, you need to consult your dermatologist. He will guide you in the right way.  For more information consult a general medicine physician online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/general-medicine-physician"

Spinal anesthesia is good for surgeries below umbilicus eg., pelvic surgeries, and ovarian cyst as in your case. But the size of your cyst is large, more than 10 cm and it is a complex cyst (not simple) which would mean surgeon may have to see other intrabdominal structures also and may take more time to complete surgery, also you may feel uncomfortable if he has to extend incision above the umbilicus.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I have a doubt about the cervical cancer. I know that it is caused by HPV. What are the other channels for the entry of virus into the body apart from sex? If wife and husband both are virgin at the time of marriage and are sincere after marriage, is there any chance of getting cervical cancer? Doctor: Hello. Cervical cancer is caused principally by two strains of HPV (human papillomavirus) - 16 and 18. Though there are more than 400 serotypes present but only 144 have been identified till date and of these high risk types being 16, 18, 31, 33, 34, 45, 52, and 58 which constitute 90% of cervical cancer cases. HPV commonly spreads through vaginal or anal sex. It can also pass when the infected person has no signs or symptoms. Though you have been sexually active with only one person, you can get HPV. Even a mere skin to skin contact with a HPV infected person can spread HPV. But the fact is, unless the above mentioned strains are not detected on HPV DNA studies during pap smear, it is unlikely that you shall get cervical cancer. Even if both of you are virgin and do not have HPV still if you do not have the high risk strains, you may have other strains of HPV as commensals which with regular sex often can undergo mutation and beget high risk strains. So, the best is to get a HPV vaccination done before you undertake sexual activity ideally, else as per guidelines HPV vaccination should be given to all women between 9-45 age group irrespective of their sexual activity status.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I just had my second urolift a week back. My doctor-surgeon pinned down the median lobe of the prostate and removed a bladder stone during that surgery. Had voiding trial two days back. Urinated out about 200 cc at urologist's office. I think she put in 300 cc if I recall correctly. Went home and had to come back and be recatheterized at 4:30 PM. Had 485 cc in. My bladder at that point was able to get a fairly good stream going for a while but then got spasms and just dribbling so the amount out was not good enough to handle the amount of liquid going into the bladder. The head of my penis had stopped bleeding from the surgery but the recatheterization has caused it to start bleeding again. PA wants another voiding trial next week. I am concerned that this is too soon and that the wound inside the head of my penis will never heal and the spasms which do not allow me to accomplish a successful voiding trial will never cease if I am not given enough time to heal. Your thoughts? Doctor: Hi. In urolift, there is no cutting and therefore no wound. The prostate tissue is pinned to its covering and this widens the urine tube. So one week's rest should be fine for whatever healing there has to occur. The spasms that occur with a catheter in place are due to bladder trying to push out the catheter and these go once the catheter is removed. I think another trial of catheter removal is fine. If it does not work, or you are not happy with the flow or symptoms, or if you have more than 100 to 150 cc residue, better to undergo a formal TURP or HoLEP surgery for the prostate. It is an endoscopically performed, under anesthesia and little side effects. In your case, the urolift is causing problems and this defeats the whole purpose of urolift being less invasive than prostate surgery."

I tried all methods to control my anger, but it does not work. Is there any treatment to control anger? Doctor: Hello. Anger is an emotion. When anger rises, our animal instinct tries to protect our-self resulting in aggressive behavior. Aggressive behavior happens only when anger goes out of control. Getting angry is fine. But you should make sure that it does not cross the boundary. In my opinion, instead of controlling anger after it is triggered, you should try not to get emotional at all. Understanding the circumstances and correct perception should help you never even start the emotion. Anger management therapy is the management of anger after it got triggered. That should be useless. I could suggest some cognitive behavior therapy method in this aspect."

If I sit for a long time in the same position, then I can feel some pain in the same area, but there is no pus or abscess. But,\u00a0there is a scar in the area where the fistula opening was and when I touch it, it feels different than that of the other skin area. Can I consider this as my fistula has healed on its own? Is there any other problem that I should consider? What are the other precautions I have to take in order to make the area feel more comfortable? Is there any chance that the fistula can spread to other parts internally? Doctor: Hi. Digital rectal examination, proctoscopy and fistulogram. Fistula-in-ano. Surgical excision of fistula.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I used to play football a few years ago, however, I had to stop playing due to symptoms of immediate fatigue after a maximum of one sprint, wheezing, dizziness and palpitations. They were first attributed to asthma, however, upon having a cardiac MRI, I was told there are no issues with my lungs and the problem lies with my heart. They took an ECG and I was told I have two slightly impaired valves with some regurgitation and a slightly swollen right side. I might possibly have ARVC, however, I am still waiting to get a Holter strapped. What I would like to know is, will the Holter definitely let the doctors know if I have ARVC? If it is not the case can the performance of my valves be rectified or will my heart's condition remain permanent? Doctor: Hi. ARVC (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) is diagnosed on echocardiography or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Then further risk stratified on past history, family history of ARVC or sudden death in the first degree relatives, or Holter monitoring to detect ventricular tachycardia. Furthermore, genetic testing can be done, especially if your first degree relatives also have the same disease. Competitive sports are a risk factor for the progression of this disease and also for sudden death. So exertion is contraindicated. It will be easy for me to guide you better if you share your echocardiography, and MRI reports with me and also send ECG."

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, The use of moisturizer or face wash made my skin glow. If not for five to six days, my skin would become very dull even without any sun exposure. So, I used them regularly. But, I had stopped applying anything on my face for about three months and then my facial skin stopped responding to them. Now my face is much darker than my body. I have tried scrubbing and even chemical peel but no results are seen. I do not think any signs of disease are shown. Then what could be the reason? Doctor: Hi. My inference from the above is that your skin is facing lack of oil. There is dryness which makes your skin vulnerable to sun and other external influences. Hence it gets dark. However, with moisturizer, the skin gets adequate moisture and hydration and stays supple and healthy. I suggest you to restart applying the moisturizer on a daily basis. Also, there are combinations of moisturizer + sunscreen + fairness creams in the market. They are offered by all leading brands like Garnier, Neutrogena, Vaseline, Ponds and many more. These creams are very effective as they provide the required moisture and oils for the skin. They prevent sun-related damage and darkening by acting as a sunscreen that prevents contact of sun rays on the skin. They have ingredients which overtime lightens your skin. At the same time, please check if your skin gets excessively dry after face wash. Use a mild moisturizing face wash and not any soap. Also, do not use face washes which are meant for people with oily skin as they will dry the skin even more and help evaporate the skin oils."

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Doctor: Hi. I have gone through your query and find that you are physically active and healthy. You have phimosis but that is not causing you much problem. For the last few occasions you have erection problems and delayed ejaculation, it can occur because of many issues including the stress or performance or time hurry. Once you had one episode of ED (erectile dysfunction) or delayed ejaculation it can cause you anxiety and that can lead to ED for the next sexual activity. If the issue is not affecting you regularly or at least 50 percent of your sexual activity then it is not required any medical treatment.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Your nasal symptoms are more suggestive of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The dizzy feeling and associated changes are more suggestive of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). There is no direct relation between both symptoms, but an allergic exacerbation may aggravate BPPV. For allergy, the treatment of choice is skin prick test and immunotherapy. Please contact an allergy specialist. That is the only way to cure an allergy, with everything else symptoms may exacerbate on and off. BPPV is a condition that may not show any findings on MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computed tomography). Treatment of choice is vestibular rehabilitation exercise and maneuvers like Dix-hall pike and Epley,s. Antivertigo medicines are mainly supportive only. In your case, you have to get both the conditions treated simultaneously. I hope this helps. Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, BPPV. Vestibular rehabilitation exercises."

Even then, if you want to have medical treatment or find it convenient, I would like to say it is temporary and the choice is yours. It is better to have a total abdominal hysterectomy as you do not need fertility. It is a whole surgery, but if done nicely there should be no long-term side effects.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I am a 33-year-old male. I would like to consult about my recurring mild cough during night time, and sneeze and runny nose in the morning that usually go away before lunchtime. I recently consulted a pulmonary doctor due to severe cough she gave me antibiotics, anti-histamine in the morning, Seretide oral spray, and medicine that uses a nebulizer. I have finished it, the cough as well as the sneezing, and runny nose went away for a couple of days. Suddenly the mild cough, sneezing, and runny nose came back. I also mentioned the recurring allergic attack to the pulmonary doctor that is why she gave me the anti-histamine because she told me that the cough might be an allergic reaction. I just take in vitamin C tablets and ginger daily. I do not use any medications right now. Last night I experienced mild cough again, I have resorted to use the Seretide oral spray because I experience slight discomfort in breathing. I have no idea what I could be allergic to? I have no food allergy. I usually have a jacket when I sleep because we sleep with air condition on. It is fine if it is just me but I sleep with my partner and a 2-year-old kid in a room. I do not have a fever or any symptoms of Coronavirus. I can no longer consult an allergologist near me due to the lockdown in our area. I hope you can put an end to this recurring problem. Thanks. Doctor: Hi. Please continue the antihistaminic. Preferably pair it up with Montelukast. Take the medicine at 6 PM in the evening. You need a steroidal nasal spray like Mometasone as well. Take Albuterol inhaler SOS and a Budesonide inhaler twice daily for a week. Avoid exposure to cold air from the AC. Keep the blower of Aircon away from you. Keep an optimum temperature of 25 degrees. Do not lie down directly under the fan. Keep all surfaces extremely clean and tidy. Wipe all areas with a wet cloth every few days. Keep carpets, curtains, upholsteries, puffed toys, etc., very clean and dust free. Wash your beddings twice a week with warm water."

Doctor: Hello. Failure in exam is quite common and always remember that it is only a temporary setback. Almost all successful people would have failed an exam at some point in their life. Do not put too much pressure on yourself by hiding it from your parents. It can be a difficult burden. Your parents may be upset, but eventually, they will get over it. After initial disappointment settles down, they will support you. Learn to develop coping strategies to manage frustrations. You will come out stronger in the long term. Try to distract yourself and relax for some days. Then plan to retake the exam with better preparation. Make sure you eat well, sleep regularly, listen to relaxing music, talk to supportive friends and family. If anxiety is just situational nothing to worry, it will get better when the situation improves. But if it is persistent, you will benefit from some counseling to manage anxiety."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore. Doctor: Hello. The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling. Get an X-ray done to find out the exact problem and stronger antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) along with a painkiller for a week.

Try to gently explore their diagnoses but do not push too much if they are hesistant to share more information at present. They need to have regular follow-ups with their psychiatrist or prescribing doctor. Encourage them to attend regularly and offer to accompany them. Avoid social isolation.

It comes out in loads which were not like that in years back just before I had a D and C three years back. I have been trying to get pregnant but to no avail and I suspect this could be due to the D and C and the sperm leakage because the leakage is not normal. Though I had complications after the D and C, some fetal remnants which caused severe pain, came out on its own the next day but still bled for 10 days with the pain minimal. Please, do you have an idea about how this could be causing infertility problems. Doctor: Hi. Fertilisation of ova requires a single sperm, and a normal male ejaculate contains millions of them. So sperm leakage should not be the only concern causing your subfertility. You need to go through some tests for you and your partner to rule out other causes as well. D and C (dilatation and curettage) sometimes cause intrauterine adhesions or tubal block, which may be a cause in some cases of infertility. Husband's recent semen analysis, transvaginal scan to rule out PCOS, intrauterine pathology, fibroids, blood parameters: LH, FSH, TSH, prolactin on the third day of periods."

I have never been without smell for this long after a normal cold and I have had a fairly clear nose for the entire duration of it so it cannot be due to congestion.

First, is that you have Coronavirus infection and the cold, allergy, and loss of smell are due to it unless you develop more severe symptoms like fever, temperature, breathing difficulty, respiratory distress, you do not go anywhere out of home. You are gonna remain quarantined till 15 days from now. Take plenty of fluids and water. Eat good and normal diet. Exercise indoors if you can. Second, it is allergy-related. In this case, it should subside in some time. You can try some nasal steroids and other measures told above. In the first scenario also nasal steroids can be tried.

My blood work and CT abdomen are fine. Doctor: Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. The cervical spine x-ray AP (anteroposterior) and lateral views show the following. 1) There is straightening of the neck spine. 2) The alignment of the cervical spine is normal. 3) Mild early degenerative changes are noted in the vertebral bodies of the cervical spine. 4) Intervertebral disc spaces are normal in appearance except a minimal suspicious decrease in disc height C 3-C 4 disc level anteriorly. 5) There is a small bridging osteophyte at C3 anterosuperiorly vs limbus vertebra (rare possibility). This is not a serious concern. 6) Pre-vertebral soft tissues are normal. Impression: There is a possibility of neck muscle spasm and early degenerative changes in the neck spine. Left shoulder x-ray AP view shows normal shoulder joint. 1) The bones are aligned normally and left shoulder joint space is maintained. 2) The scapula, lateral end of clavicle and head of humerus on the left side are normal. I hope your query is answered. The possibility of neck muscle spasm exists with early degenerative changes in neck spine. Pinching of nerves due to disc problems (which might be seen only on MRI cervical spine) cannot be commented up on this x-ray. Further clinical neurological examination of neck spine might reveal any suspected causes for your symptoms. Orthopedic clinical examination of the left shoulder is also suggested to know any restriction of movements and whether any soft tissue structures like rotator cuff requires evaluation by an MRI shoulder. Recommended physiotherapy for few weeks and if there is no improvement or if there is worsening then the concerned area is to be evaluated by MRI scan. There is no need of doing MRI scan for both the regions. MRI scan of the cervical spine is more important in the view of muscle spasm and early degenerative changes.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem.

The left thyroid nodule measures 14 x 19 mm and is isoechoic and solid areas and shows peripheral vascularity with a small focus of possible cystic change within which can be cystic changes probably colloid changes. The right thyroid nodule is 4 x 4 mm and is iso to hypoechoic. It is too small to comment on vascularity. There is no calcification in the nodules. In my opinion, it is likely to be a benign condition but FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) from the larger left thyroid nodule is suggested for confirmation.

Previous medical history includes that he had diarrhea for about 25 days, out of which about one week was severe. He had about 85 times in a week and hospitalized. While in hospital, he had increased potassium (4.7) and was given a nebulizer for two days. On the discharge, potassium was 4.4 and they said it was normal. This happened two months ago and from the day of discharge, he has been normal. Last week, visited a urologist for UTI like symptoms. They checked urine sample and also took a blood sample. All other parameters were normal, except potassium which was 6.2. Later, it was 4.4 and doctor said some sampling error. I have attached his urine test report. Our doctor said there is no urinary tract infection. What is causing this pain, if not UTI? We had US abdomen two months back during the diarrhea issue and it was normal.

Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you. Doctor: Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

New environment and a new job come with new challenges. And it is not the rule of life that you should get what you want or people with a similar hobby and habit will meet you every time, everywhere. We are the ones who make people alike and the important thing is we accept people with their mistake. Nobody is perfect. Try to make them a friend. If they are uninteresting, then you can make them interesting. It is not their ability, it is yours. The best way to defeat depression is to keep talking. Say everything in your mind so that your mind and heart feels light. You can start other activities also like gym, playing games or the activity you want to do. Keep yourself busy anytime and stop thinking on trivial issues. You say you are introvert. Most of us are introvert. Nobody wants to face anyone thinking that something bad might happen. Come out of that fear. What people will say, what they are thinking. It is your life, you can live it with your own rules. Social phobia is very common. Everyone has hesitation during a presentation. So, do not bother about that as you start presenting in your own way. It will subside. I am not prescribing any treatment because psychiatric medicines are not over the counter drugs. You can take them by prescription. You should start a psychotherapy session if you feel demotivated."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Does Klonopin increase the risk of QT prolongation or other serious heart problems? I just do not want to take any risk, because I have been suffering form PVCs every day for over a year. Sometimes I have also bradycardia and every now and then short burst of an accelerated heartbeat with fluttering sensation. They are still under investigation. I have had lots of ECGs, and at one my QT, QTc was 412, 447 at a heart rate of 71 bpm. And I would not like to make my QT any longer. I have also used Oxazepam. Is it a safer option when it comes to the risk of QT prolongation or can I continue taking Klonopin? Doctor: Hello. Long term Clonazepam, as well as high dose clonazepam, puts you at a risk for developing acquired long QT, having said that a QTC of 447 msec is within the prescribed i.e < 460 msec limit for women. Oxazepam is safer but if you combine either of these with another QT prolonging drug, the QT may become dangerously prolonged, also avoid a low potassium blood level and diuretics (medications which promote urination). Your description of PVCs leads me to suggest a Holter and ECG just to rule out any pause dependent arrhythmia. Do get an echo done to rule out structural heart disease."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I think that I will become maniac in some days. I am going with periods and tend to masturbate the second time. First time on the first day of the cycle and then now on the third day. My urges have become quite high, and I need help to control it. Even I am going by some emotional distresses, and maybe because of that, I tend to masturbate. I want to control and be normal. I feel very tired nowadays and not willing to work at all. Doctor: Hello. Hormonal imbalances may make one's sexual drive higher. Some women do feel increased arousal during periods. First of all, it is okay to masturbate even when you are under some distress. Though for some religious reasons and cultural norms, it becomes not acceptable by society, that is alright. Researches show that there is no negative impact of masturbation physically. However, feeling tired showed that it does not help you get out of your emotional distress, that is a problem. If you do not feel relaxed afterward than you need to channelize your urges towards physical exertion, exercise or increase water intake and improve diet. It is also good to consult some counselor to relieve your stress and learn individualized coping strategies."

Doctor: Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms are not related to dementia or Alzheimer. At your age, considering the description of your complaints, I would think about a concentration disorder (attention disorder). This could be related to ADHD or anxiety.

He is also taking allergy medication. Since then the previous rash subsided. Now that he completed his 30 days prescription, he got another set of rashes and has irritation and burning sensation and redness. Can you prescribe for his symptoms? Doctor: Hello. I have examined the pictures as well as the details sent by you (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I find a similarity of the condition with irritant dermatitis complicated by steroid dependence. Had I been able to examine him in person, I would have asked him about the evolution of the rash and other details. I believe his original picture has been modified with the use of Steroids and he has developed dependence to this class of drugs. This is clear from the fact that after completion of the 30 days course, he again started having the symptoms. He can be relieved of his problem but we will have to proceed in a systematic manner. In this case, I would have recommended the use of either mild or moderately potent steroid creams with an intent to control the acute episode and gradually taper them off to a point where he can stay normal without Steroids. I might have considered providing Mometasone or Betamenthasone creams initially and slowly start diluting them with cold cream to reduce their potency. Then I would have gone on to increase the proportion of cold cream till I could control the rash just with cold cream. All this while I would have depended heavily on antiallergics like Levocetirizine or Desloratadine. In such a situation, cold compresses are a great help. Just ensure that he does not have any factor that could aggravate his problems like diabetes or other contact allergies. I am sure by following the recommendations, your dad would soon be in his comfort zone."

The thing I am scared about is, my doctor asked me why my ferritin has not increased (just the opposite, it has decreased from 5.79 to 5.77) after three months of taking iron supplements. My other iron levels are at 39 which has increased considering those references. But, that was probably because I did not use the medicine correctly, I was only taking 5 mg a day. Another thing I am worried about is, my lymphocytes kind of got increased in my blood: (52.8) - the reference is 19.4 to 44.9, and the other one is 3.57. My neutrophils kind of decreased too (36.9) and the reference was between 41.0 to 73.0. In the last week, I had a viral infection as both my parents were sick. Is it why my levels got high? My WBC is 6.77 and RBC is 4.52. My hemoglobin is also increasing actually, last time I checked, it was 11.0 and now it is 11.2. Still low, but it was good to see that it was increasing. My thrombocyte levels got higher again, unfortunately. The first time I was told that I was anemic, my thrombocyte levels were on 485, then in my second blood test (after using iron supplements correctly it decreased to 380. And yesterday, when I checked, it increased to 435 (reference is 156 to 373). I was also told that I have an infection in my urinary system and he gave me antibiotics. Honestly, I have been always getting suspected about it since my anemia has started. Should I be worried about my condition or is it normal? Doctor: Hello. In viral infection, lymphocytosis means increased lymphocytes and neutrophil is relatively low because of increased lymphocytes. Platelet can be high in iron deficiency anemia. It is not a matter of worry just now. You can provide your reports to guide you further. Your hemoglobin level is mildly low and you should be given a good iron-containing medication like Ferrous ascorbate (brand name Orofer that contains 100 mg elemental iron). It should be taken without break for the prescribed duration. The underlying cause for iron deficiency anemia also should be ruled out like bleeding, parasites infestation, etc. Repeat your CBC after a few days.

Please suggest me some creams, so that it should not show any side effects. Also, how long I should use it? If I use anything, then will it have any effect in case of pregnancy, etc? Please help me. Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/dermatologist"

Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

Doctor put braces on my upper jaw as the problem was in the upper jaw teeth. But after two to three years teeth starting shifting and now I have developed spaces between teeth randomly and in between front two teeth as well. Need advice that whether again getting braces treatment would fix the problem or not? And what could be the possible reason behind this problem? Doctor: Hello. The reason for relapse are many, 1. Dietary habits, eating hard food, putting much pressure on teeth. 2. Not using retainers up to the suggested time. 3. Internal factors such as lower teeth or jaw alignment which might be interfering with upper jaw alignment. 4. Other habits such as tongue thrusting or mouth breathing if any you have, and wrong brushing techniques. 5. I would suggest you go to some other orthodontist, as you are not satisfied with the earlier one, an OPG will be taken, kindly reply me back with the same. We can then further discuss the treatment plan."

From the inner heel (center) upwards, the pain is on the inside. I do not remember having any considerable swelling if any. The pain has not gone away. It has produced muscular pain in my shin area as well. I assume from not being able to walk properly on that foot. I am flat-footed. Doctor: Hi. People with flat foot usually develop such a problem later in life and in addition, there is dysfunction of the posterior tibial tendon which adds to your problem. It would be really helpful if you can tell more details about your symptoms like is it more on walking, if yes then is it more on an even surface or uneven surface. For now, go for conservative management. Do intrinsic foot muscle exercises, hot fomentation, and painkillers on SOS basis. When your problem is increased beyond your tolerance and hampering your daily routine then diagnostic injection can be given in joints of foot one by one to look for the main culprit and then it can be surgically fused."

Phenytoin is secreted in breast milk but the most chance of baby getting affected are in the first three months of pregnancy. But in your case, she already delivered the baby and her seizures are well controlled on Eptoin 100 mg TDS. And I hope the baby is healthy born. In such case, she can continue Eptoin as she is taking.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Sometimes, I feel tremor in my fingers and hand and pain throughout the nerves of hand. I have these symptoms for almost 8 months now. I used to get fever at night. I consulted a physician and he prescribed me some antibiotics and multivitamin tablets. He asked me to get a Vitamin B12 test. My vitamin B12 was 173 and vitamin D was 4.7. He suggested me to go for vitamin B12 injections. After taking injections for two days the pain became severe and my normal activity got affected. So, I stopped the injections. Then, I consulted a neurologist and he prescribed me Meganeuron and Uprise D3. I am taking that for more than a month now and I do not feel any change in pain. In fact back pain got severe now. When I hold something in hand, I feel the pain radiates from the shoulder to hand followed by nerves of hand and then throughout fingers.

So, last week I consulted another neurologist and he gave me Rexipra and advised me to continue it for 3 months. When I got to know that it is for depression and anxiety, I did not take that. After taking B12 injections I repeated all blood tests and now my vitamin B12 level is 360. Please find the attachment and give a solution. Doctor: Hi. I have reviewed the attached reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I would here by say that you may not believe vitamin B12 and vitamin D deficiency are very common in some races and we always misdiagnose these symptoms. Your symptoms are due to anxiety and not due to Vitamin B12 and D. Moreover you have taken the treatment with no relief. Share my opinion with your doctor. I would recommend in such case SSRI (Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor) like Escitalopram with a beta blocker like Propranolol if your chest condition, pulse rate and blood pressure permits."

Bit history about me is that in my childhood I used to be sick with cold and cough a lot of time and my weight was always less. After I started getting periods, they were irregular. So, I consulted a gynecologist and she gave me some Multivitamins and they became normal. When I stopped taking them, they again became irregular. At the age of 18, I consulted another gynecologist and he said I have a cyst in one of my ovaries, so, he gave me a medicine to dissolve the cyst. My stomach was very painful at that time. Then, after that again the periods became normal and again after some time, they became irregular. So, when I consulted another gynecologist, she gave contraception pills. They were normal until I was taking them. Now, I have stopped taking any medication from past two years and suddenly from past six months, my weight has gradually increased. My height is 5.2 and my weight is 59. Recently had a scan done and the doctor says they have found a very minor cyst in both the ovaries. And he has suggested losing some weight. But even when I was underweight, I had the same issue. What shall I do? Shall I keep taking the Multivitamins until my meditating age and stop after that? Doctor: Hello. I just read your query. Also ask your doctor about thyroid function test because it can also cause this problem. Yes, you can take Multivitamin as advised to you on and off or for a long time, if you feel better. You can also take following Ayurvedic treatment for the management of your irregular periods and for management of your cyst. Aloe vera juice 15 ml two times a day with water after food for one month. Tablet Kanchnnar gugglu two tablets two times a day with lukewarm water for one month.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

He received an epidural yesterday for pain in his hips and buttocks, and my mother found his medication list and shared it with me. I am somewhat alarmed about the anti-depressants and opioid combinations in particular after doing some research on serotonin syndrome. Kindly evaluate his prescription. Doctor: Hi. Looking at the age and co-morbid conditions, the polypharmacy (multiple drugs) is a must. At the same time, the clinician will assess (monitor) the patient for any serious side effects or drug incompatibility. Since your father has many geriatric complaints, I feel all these drugs are required. Due to old age, he may be having some trouble with kidney or liver functions. Most of the drug gets metabolized in the liver and excreted through the kidneys. Hence, continuous monitoring is required as per the clinician's advice. I hope you are following the clinician's advice. Regarding depression and pain in the hip, the antidepressant drugs and analgesics are unavoidable. Please do not worry about its side effects like serotonin syndrome. This is not seen in all the patients. The symptoms of serotonin syndrome will be taken care of by other antihypertensive or cardiac drugs. Sometimes, he develops diarrhea. As I told earlier, do not worry about the side effects. These are not seen in all patients, and these drugs are mandatory for your father. He can avoid tyramine rich foods (example: beer, chocolate, alcoholic beverages, fermented foods, cheese, sore cream, yogurt, shrimp paste, soy sauce, soybean condiments, teriyaki sauce, tempeh, miso soup, sauerkraut, kimchi, etc.). The antidepressant drugs cause side effects only if more tyramine rich food is consumed while under the medication. I hope this helps."

She is 13 years old now and at present she has been taking Valparin Chrono 500 and Levipil 750 both twice daily. She attained puberty before two years and presently studying in sixth standard. She has a learning disability, forgets everything very quickly and needs to be treated specially. But it will not be possible on the part of that school as the school does not provide any special classes for learners with LD or does not have any provision for CWSN. On the other hand, there is no any institution in my locality which provides special education to CWSN. Under the circumstances stated above, I have left no option except to enroll her in an open school and give necessary support to her. Now my question is will it be fine for her in the future to lead a life without any social development? Doctor: Hi. Your daughter has two independent medical problems. The seizure disorder needs management with medications. Her learning disability needs appropriate assessment and remedial work. I do understand that most schools do not offer remedial teaching and they leave the parents with no option other than NIOS (National Institute of open schooling). However, in most cities, there are organizations which are involved in remedial teaching for children with LD (learning disability). You can look up such organizations in your town. Also, children with LD are normal in social and occupational spheres. For more information consult a neurologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/neurologist"

Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you. Doctor: Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am a 36 year old\u00a0male. 17 years ago, I began experiencing high levels of anxiety and depression. I was put on Zoloft. After about five years, I was moved to Lexapro as Zoloft was not working. After being on Lexapro\u00a0for five years,\u00a0I was moved to Pristiq. After 5 years on Pristiq, I finally had enough. With each of these medications, I had a very similar side effect. I became emotionally numb. Before going through this, I was a very active, outgoing individual. While on these medications, I became removed, uninterested, and experienced very little emotions. So,\u00a0I decided to take an extensive test to identify if I had other mental health issues. The results came back that I do have general anxiety but, also ADHD. I was put on Adderall XR and I\u00a0did not like it. It made me very irritable. I have stopped taking that. Now, my doctor has me on Wellbutrin while at the same time taking me off off Pristiq. I do feel a decent amount of the emotional numbness is gone since going to Wellbutrin.\u00a0Here is my question: I feel like the Wellbutrin is helping the ADHD. I am not sure though if it is helping my anxiety and depression. What suggestion do you have regarding medication to tackle this? I am currently taking the Wellbutrin SR 100.\u00a0Can you please help? Doctor: Hello, Welcome to iclinq.com. I have gone through your query and understand your concern. It is true that SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) make the person emotionally blunt when on a long term use. In your case, SSRI (Zoloft and Lexapro) and Pristiq (Desvenlafaxine) are ineffective and making you emotionally numb. You are diagnosed with ADHD (attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder) and anxiety, and Adderall ( a combination of Amphetamine and Dextroamphetamine) makes you irritable. So, that did not help you as well. Now, over to your question. Wellbutrin is the second drug of choice in ADHD after psychostimulants. So, it will definitely help you. This drug is also effective in depression and it reduces the emotional numbness caused by SSRI. The doses of Wellbutrin can be increased up to 300 mg per day in divided doses. But, Wellbutrin is not effective in anxiety. So, to control anxiety you can try a beta-blocker like Propranolol or Benzodiazepine for the short term. Try meditation or cognitive behavioral therapy to manage anxiety in the long term. Thanks and regards.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Based on your query, my opinion is as follows: C-ANCA (Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) positivity indicates Wegener's Granulomatosis. In this condition, there is involvement of upper and lower respiratory tract and kidneys. Most common diagnosis, while kidneys are effected, is Lupus. But I suppose your ANA and anti-Ds DNA are negative.  I would like to see all your reports, and I also recommend you to get an x-ray of paranasal sinuses to see for any polyps that are associated with Wegener's Granulomatosis. A chest x-ray may show a cavitary lesion. You need a kidney biopsy, first of all, followed by which you will be started on immunosuppressive therapy. Steroids and other immunosuppressive agents like Cyclophosphamide, Azathioprine are used. Prognosis and life expectancy can be commented after the report of kidney biopsy, as most of the times fatality occur due to renal failure. I hope it helps."

Her iron is 13 ug/dL, iron binding is 484 ug/dL, iron saturation is 3 %, and ferritin is 3 ng/mL. I have attached her CBC report. Are her reports indicative of something serious? She also has pain between her legs and the pelvic area. She has vitamin D deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency. She also had iron-deficiency anemia in the past, for which she took Ferrous sulfate. She is currently taking vitamin D and Thyrax medicines. Doctor: Hello. I have gone through your wife's reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The report shows schistocytes, which are fragmented RBC (red blood cell), commonly seen in hemolytic anemia. So, to rule out hemolysis, serum LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), reticulocyte count, and serum bilirubin should be tested. If hemoglobinopathy is suspected, then HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) can be done. As there is a history of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), which decreases the iron level and increases TIBC (total iron binding capacity). So, treatment for IDA should be started with iron tablets like Ferrous sulfate or iron injections. Her monocyte count is slightly elevated, but absolute monocyte count is more important which is within the normal limits. Total WBC count is low, which can be due to any drug, infections like tuberculosis, typhoid, parvovirus B19, temporary infection, EBV (Epstein-Barr) virus infection, etc. Hence for that clinical examination and correlation has to be done. But in smear, no abnormal cells are seen, so there is nothing alarmingly wrong. Continue treatment for iron-deficiency anemia. Repeat peripheral smear after ten to twenty days and follow-up.

I suggest back strengthening exercises and Pregabalin 75 mg once a day for two weeks. Vitamin B12 levels and HbA1c should be helpful.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

If in case if the coconut vendor had HIV, could it be possible that the blood on the straw could have had touched my chapped lips and infected me? Doctor: Hi. Your risk of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) acquisition is unwarranted in this case. HIV can only be transmitted by sexual contact, through the exchange of contaminated syringes or needles, blood transfusion or there can be vertical transmission from HIV infected mother to her child during pregnancy, delivery or through breast milk. HIV cannot survive outside the body or even in the old healed lesions or bruised sites."

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have seen the images (attachment removed to protect patient identity) An ectopic pregnancy happens when the fetus starts developing at a location other than the uterus. In your case, the pregnancy is developing at the end of the left tube which is called the fimbria. You can see in the pictures that the uterus is empty and a sac-like structure is visualized in the location which is probably the end of the left tube. The developing fetus is very small and looks like a small straight line in the sac. The orange spots are flowing blood and usually, the growing gestational sac has blood flow which can be seen like a ring in cases of ectopic pregnancy. Regards.

I saw her report and photos both (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Her weight has to be reduced which can be done through some exercise. Try doing that as much as she can. Her body weight is causing main problems. For her pain, she can take tablet Etoshine 60 mg once in a day. If more severe then twice a day after meal. Her HbA1c is 6.5 percent which makes her a diabetic. Start tablet Gluconorm SR 500 mg (Metformin) after dinner daily.

Coming on to the bad taste and bad odor, it could be due to any deposits in the socket or anywhere else in the mouth. Even a dry mouth can cause it. But if you feel it is really extreme, you can visit your dentist who will irrigate the socket and also find out the reason after a clinical examination. If it is a dry socket, by any chance, a sedative dressing will be given. Usually, dry socket gives these symptoms but along with severe pain by second to the third day of tooth removal. Ultimately, it is not an emergency. You can continue lukewarm salt water gargling and limit the usage of mouthwashes. If pain or this bad taste and odor continues, visit your nearby dentist.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I would like to know an orthopedist opinion about my mother's situation. She had femur plasmacytoma 20 years ago and 4 prostheses, because she had many infections after the operations. She remained with her external popliteus paralyzed. Now, she began to feel his knee mobile, and she could not walk because of it. There are some noises too. A few doctors said she needs Megasystem-C Link prosthesis, which would totally replace her hip and knee. What is your advice? Is there any intermediate option, like replacing only the actual prosthesis and adding pieces of bone? We heard that, in case of choosing the Megasystem-C, that can lead to amputation. So, we are looking for a second opinion. I have attached the radiograph links, please check. Doctor: Hello. The entire femur seen is grossly osteoporotic and the knee is showing evidence of osteoarthritis though I could not see the knee in the AP view. She needs a knee replacement but with the large hip prosthesis and very weak bone stock, I would support the use of a total femoral replacement. This, in reality, would need the whole femur to be removed but is not equivalent to amputation. The knee would have to be a constrained variety of her knee ligaments."

Is there anything else we can do to try to ease her pain. She is bellowing out in pain every 5 minutes. Doctor: Hi. Shingles or Herpes Zoster occur due to reactivation of chicken pox virus which hide in spinal nerve ganglion during childhood. Reactivation can occur in immunosuppression or old age, thus it runs along a nerve in girdle like fashion. It starts with fluid filled lesion which heal within upto 2 weeks but nerve damage can give severe pain which may last longer. It is called post herpetic neuralgia. I hope there is no active fluid filled lesion. If so kindly send a photo and Renal function test report. Otherwise start SR tablet Pregabalin 25 mg plus 1500 mcg Methylcobalamin tablet twice daily. Capsaicin or Lidocaine patch application. Tablet Tramadol if severe pain SOS once daily. Calamine lotion thrice daily. Review after 4 weeks. It is sometime resistant. Other modalities like intraspinal steroid or botox injection can also be tried but let's fist see how this responds."

Due to this, your protein C and S values are low. 2. Once thrombosis has been seen, future risk of thrombus formation is present. 3. Yes, you will need to take Warfarin for life to prevent future risk of thrombus. Get evaluated with a maintenance INR of 2-3. 4. Stockings beneficial.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

All therapies are aimed at making you comfortable with whatever your orientation is. There should be no shame in accepting your orientation. No, Buspirone does not have any sexual side effects.

All the close contacts should be treated simultaneously in the same manner. Clothing, sheets, etc., should be washed thoroughly with hot water to prevent re-infection from clothing.

However, for the past 6 months, my symptoms and use of the medicines has diminished to the point I have not had to take the DDAVP for six months. Etiology unknown as to why I developed DI. Have you ever experienced a person going into remission with DI? Or should I be concerned as I have been having some facial numbs and arm numbness and sometime my equilibrium seems of? Doctor: Hello.  It is rare but yes it is possible that over a long period of time, diabetes inspidus can auto correct itself. Over time some, ADH nerve terminals are able to form at the base of the hypothalamus, resulting in the resolution of DI symptoms and the development of an ectopic posterior pituitary. In your case that might be happening and it is a good thing. DI over a period of time is known to cause muscle weakness, and can lead to nerve disorders. I will recommend you to consult a neurologist for your facial numbness, he can perform some tests on you to get the correct picture. Meanwhile you should take a Multivitamin supplement which has Methyl cobalamin and Folic acid (tablet Neurobion Forte once daily for around a month) and check if there is any improvement in your symptoms. It helps in nerve conduction, so might be helpful in your case. Regarding the spontaneous emission, we have to wait and watch.

Firstly, I guess you do not have any other symptoms like shortness of breath or chest pain. It is worthwhile to get yourself auscultated by a local doctor to rule out structural heart disease, although that appears to be less likely. You should avoid fatty, oily and spicy diet. Have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. You should get prescribed tablet Pan DSR (Pantoprazole and Domperidone) 40 mg or Esomeprazole-Domperidone combination before breakfast once a day for two weeks. Also, you should get prescribed tablet Etizola beta (Etizolam and Propranolol) 0.25/20 mg bedtime for two weeks, if the heart rate is at least more than 65 per minute. This may cause slight sedation. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. Also, try to divert your mind to other activities and do not think much about this to reduce the anxiety and nervousness. Because, the feeling of heartbeat does not mean you are suffering from disease, and one can feel it normally as well. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it?

Sores can heal better by avoiding acidic or highly salty foods and any other substances that are irritating. An anesthetic such as Lidocaine may be used as a mouth rinse. Sucralfate and Aluminum-magnesium antacids can be soothing when applied alone.  Some mouth sores can be treated with a low-powered laser, which relieves pain immediately and prevents sores from returning. Chemically burning the sore with a small stick coated with silver nitrate may similarly relieve pain but is not as effective as a laser. Also, advise you to do warm salt water rinses to keep the infection at bay."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My mother is 55 years old. She is taking Jalra-M for diabetes and Thyronorm 50 mg for thyroid daily. Her diabetes is under control with her HbA1C also under control. We had the tests four months back. Her fasting sugar is around 100 mg/dL. About 25 days back, she had a pain on the left side of the chest which could be pin pointed to last few bones of rib cage just above the stomach. This pain comes again when pressed at that same point of the rib cage and got aggravated if she used to take a very deep breaths or sleep on that side of the chest. We consulted a doctor and he advised a chest x-ray and ECG both came out normal. On this, he advised DFO gel to be applied. In this period she also experienced weakness and fatigue. After 15 days of initial pain, although her pain was very very low she used to have a slight discomfort while inhaling deep and felt weak. So the doctor suggested to do a CT scan of the chest and advised calcium, and vitamin supplements. Now there is no pain even on pressing and even while inhaling deep. Sometimes when she sleeps on the same side of the chest a very slight discomfort is observed, sometimes at back or some times at below chest rib cage bones. I am also worried as I found out that she has lost 2 kg in the last one month without any change in the diet and more than 5 kg in the last one and a half years. Although her energy levels are almost back to normal. She does feel the heat more than others and her last BP was 130/77 mmHg and her heart rate is 97 bpm. She feels thirsty more nowadays. My questions are, should I get the ct scan done. Is the benefit more than the radiation risk? What should I do for weight loss? Does any further investigation is warranted here? Please reply. Doctor: Hello. You have neither mentioned the duration of diabetes, latest fasting, PP (post prandial) blood sugar levels, HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) value or the latest TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels. Please furnish the required information, as well as, her BP (blood pressure). Further, the description of chest pain is suggestive of either (a) simple spasm of the muscles between the ribs (which incidentally, would have improved with a short course of muscle relaxants and warranted no further tests, including CT scan). (b) Inflammation of the left lung covering (pleura), which if associated with weight loss and low-grade fever could be tubercular. (c) Coronary heart disease (chest pain associated with weakness and fatigue), particularly in the case of long-standing diabetes. I will therefore strongly recommend that she undergoes either TMT (tread mill stress test) or stress echocardiography to exclude or confirm heart disease. Also, weight loss or gain is a common occurrence in diabetes. Anti-diabetic drug Metformin (M in Jalra M stands for Metformin) reduces body weight. In addition, a successful correction of hypothyroidism leads to weight loss. For her age and height, she is still overweight by 2-3 kg. I would, therefore, recommend the following initial investigations: 1. Ultrasound of the left side of the chest (for detecting the presence of fluid in the pleural cavity). 2. TMT or stress echocardiography to exclude, detect latent underlying heart disease. Lastly, I do not feel the necessity of a CT (computed tomography) scan at this stage. If she still has any chest pain, a short course of five to seven days of tablet Cip-zox (Diclofenac sodium and Paracetamol) one tablet thrice daily after meals would cure her pain, provided it is due to spasm of the chest muscles. Forwarding of the desired reports would certainly help me in reaching a definite conclusion."

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I am a 13-year-old female. I am a virgin, not on any medications and I started my period about two years back. My period has been coming nearly exactly every two weeks without fail since about a year ago. At the beginning, it was all over the place (which is to be expected), but it started evening out after a few months. It very occasionally comes slightly later. I also experience quite bad cramps (but nothing that a 15 ml dose of Nurofen cannot alleviate) along with my heavy flow. Could there be an underlying condition? Endometriosis or similar? Should I be worried? Doctor: Hello. How are you doing? Let me start by saying that you are absolutely fine. It is a human tendency to expect a big condition when it is actually a simple one. We should always think of the common conditions first. You are having immature hormone cycles and spasmodic dysmenorrhea. Let me explain. You have started periods at the right time. But, even though you have periods, the hormonal balance between brain, hypothalamus, and pituitary gland - ovaries are fully matured by 19 to 21 years only. Once this axis is fully mature, the hypothalamus produces hormones at the right time, makes pituitary to produce hormones in the right amount and which in turn gets the right level of hormones from ovaries and ovulation occurs on the right time. Now in few cycles, you do not ovulate. That is when you miss periods or you only have a discharge pink or red color. Or else you have no proper periods and the thickness inside the uterus, the endometrium keeps increasing and finally when it tries to come out of the narrow cervical canal, you get severe lower abdominal cramps. You will have the pain only till that clump of blood falls out.  The normal frequency of periods will be 28 days plus or minus seven days, bleeding for approximately five to seven days. Ovulation will be around 13th to 15th day. Do not worry. At this young age, you cannot expect big conditions. I cannot say you will not have endometriosis, but chances are very very remote. If you are fine with the medications for pain, you can go ahead with that. Over time, everything will be fine. I am sure. Hope I have cleared your query. All the best.

I read your query, and from what you have mentioned it appears that you have high DHEA levels (dehydroepiandrosterone) although I cannot understand that number clearly from the test reports that you have attached and you are not getting much benefit from Spironolactone. However, you can benefit from Dianette (cyproterone acetate, ethinylestradiol). Take it daily one tablet like a contraceptive pill. It contains an anti-androgenic drug called cyproterone acetate. It is superior to Spironolactone. You must check your liver function test before starting and every four to six weeks for the entire duration of treatment. I hope you find my advice beneficial."

These sensations have been going on for at least four days. I have sleep apnea so I sleep with a full face mask and I lay on my right side with my right arm under my head. What could these sensations be? Doctor: Hi. Post stroke, during periods of illness, fever, cold, etc., previous symptoms of stroke may reappear but to lesser degree. They usually go away as the illness resolve. It does not mean you have new stroke. With left parietal stroke, one can expect sensory symptoms over right side and depending on your location, body part, need to see your previous MRI which can help identify if your face region was in previous stroke region or scar tissue is there. If you are very concerned, then you can go for another MRI brain to look for any new stroke. MRI brain if symptom worsen or if no scar tissue in facial region on previous MRI"

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Could you please suggest to me any ayurvedic medicine for my healthy life and after masturbations headache, hair loss and how can I recover energy? Doctor: Hi. Masturbation is not bad, but if done in excess it can make you weak. A headache, low energy, and hair loss are a result of insufficient nutrition. Do you get a good night's sleep? (seven hours). How often do you get headaches? Have you noticed any triggers for a headache? These are my recommendations: Diet- Your daily diet should include one bowl of fresh fruits, preferably the ones rich in Iron and Calcium like pomegranate, papaya, sapota, guava, figs, dates, raisins, muskmelon, gooseberry. You can take one bowl of these fruits, individually or mixed every day. Proteins are essential for hair growth and energy, includes eggs, pulses, and cheese in your daily diet. Ensure you eat at the right time daily so that digestion and metabolism improves. Almonds, pumpkin seeds are also highly recommended. Exercise- to regain energy and to improve blood circulation exercise is a must. 30 minutes for brisk walk, cycling or yoga for five days a week. Medicine- Aswagandharishtam, this is a wonderful Ayurveda preparation which will target all your problems comprehensively. This is prepared using 20 odd herbs which comprehensively target all your issues- stress, weakness, hairfall, and headache. Take 5 ml of this tonic diluted in 15 ml water twice daily after food. Continue it for 15 days and then follow up with me."

I also have done an HIV test with the help of home test kit which shows result in 10 minutes. The result is negative. My questions are what are the chances of a false negative? Whether I need anymore testing like PCR, RNA/DNA test? Does three months HIV test is considered conclusive? What are the chances of transmission in case of protected sex (no anal or oral sex)? Whether deep kiss or smooch can transmit the virus? Doctor: Hi. I will answer your query specifically. In your case, the chances of false negative are almost nil. Chances of false negative are high during the window period which extends from three weeks to six months. Usually, a person having HIV has detectable antibody levels by a month. Almost 97 percent of people become seropositive by three months. By six months any person having HIV will develop antibodies. Only a few cases have been reported where seroconversion occurred late after a year. As you have done your tests at monthly intervals till six months and the results have been negative, chances of it being false negative are almost negligible. You do not need any other tests. We consider three months as conclusive but prefer to do a test at six months too. If you have used a condom, you need not worry. If only sex is unprotected chances of spreading through single contact are 0-1%. Kissing does not spread infection. I hope this helps."

Kindly do let me know if the above delay in the growth of these teeth is normal. She is taking Eltroxin 25 mg since birth. Doctor: Hello. As you mentioned your daughter is 6 years and 7 months old. Please confirm if she has lost all her upper primary teeth or lowers where the permanent teeth have come? Other thing is if all the upper four primary incisors are gone and three have come. Generally, we need to see which tooth incisor has not come out of four permanent incisors. If missing tooth is lateral incisor means next to two central incisors then we can wait and watch for another two to three months. Other scenario is if only one upper incisor is lost three to four months ago and the rest of the milk (primary incisors are intact) then we can still wait two to three more months. But if out of four upper permanent incisors, only one that too central permanent incisor has not come out, then it is better to take radiograph IOPA (intraoral periapical radiograph) x-ray first to rule out any hindrance in the eruption of the tooth or any permanent missing tooth. If possible click and share the picture of mouth (oral cavity) with teeth and send it across. Generally, a delay of one year in an eruption of permanent teeth is quite normal. But we need to confirm which tooth is missing and need to see the chronology of other teeth simultaneously to rule out any abnormal changes. Eruption delay if only one primary tooth was lost and counterpart permanent tooth is missing for the past four months. IOPA x-ray of upper front teeth.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

There is no medical treatment available for this condition in adults. Non-surgical dilatation of the opening can be practiced. But it is only for very mild cases. Your treating urologist will determine it after a thorough clinical examination. It should not be tried by yourself, as the foreskin can become stuck behind the head of the penis.

Two are about 2 mm and one is 6 mm. All blood and thyroid tests came back normal. Full body PET-CT showed no abnormal activity in thyroid or lymph nodes or anywhere else in my body. FNA of the largest lymph node came back as suspicious for metastatic papillary thyroid cancer. My ENT wants to do a selective neck dissection, removing the lymph nodes in regions 2-4, have them cold tested and remove my thyroid if positive. My question is, is it normal to have a neck dissection with only suspicion of malignancy? Or should I opt for further testing to confirm cancer before I decide to have the dissection? Doctor: Hi.

Sed rate and CRP in normal range, uric acid level tested after a bout of kidney stones last year, but that was also in normal range. Is there any tests you could suggest to my attending? Please advise. Doctor: Hello. The normal ESR and CRP essentially rules out inflammatory conditions. Uric acid levels, if high, can lead to joint pains, not body pains. Based on you height and weight, your body mass index is 37.3. This is considered morbid obesity. People with high BMIs can have issues like obstructive sleep apnea, impaired glucose tolerance and high blood pressure. Obstructive sleep apnea can present with manifestations like chronic fatigue and chronic body pains among others. If you are known to snore, have apneic spells (spells during sleep where your breathing stops for several seconds intermittently), feel fatigued and sleepy during the daytime, have frequent headaches and irritability, ask your doctor to screen you for obstructive sleep apnea. If present, that may explain your chronic body pains. Even if you do not have symptoms of OSA, losing weight can improve your overall health and prevent development of metabolic diseases like diabetes. If you want to lose weight, I suggest cutting down on carbohydrates and consuming healthy fats. This is a low carbohydrate, high and healthy fat diet (otherwise called ketogenic diet)."

I am hoping to highlight inflammatory foods, foods high in sugar, foods high in saturated and trans fat, and dairy which may be a cause for arthritis for some people due to its casein proteins. Please try to name a specific food (i.e. yogurt) and not a group of foods (i.e. dairy) and reference studies when possible.  Please specify the name of the second and third food and why it can negatively affect or worsen arthritis symptoms. Doctor: Hello. There are some lifestyle and nutrition recommendations that can be given to any patient suffering from arthritis that may help reduce the pain. Diet rich in omega-3 and antioxidants. Some studies have shown that omega-3 help decrease swelling or inflammation and the antioxidants help reduce the free radicals in the body. Avoid alcohol and red meat. Some patients suffer from high uric acid levels, which may worsen arthritis symptoms. Red meat contains high levels of purines, which are then metabolized in the kidneys and may affect and increase the uric acid levels. Alcohol dehydrates the body and this makes it even more difficult to eliminate the purines or toxins from the kidneys. The easy way to achieve a healthy weight and include omega-3 and antioxidants in the diet is by a Mediterranean diet. This means cutting back on red meat and eating fish and legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas) as the protein source. Omega-3 rich foods are healthy fats like avocado, olive oil, nuts, seeds and olives, and also salmon. The Mediterranean diet suggests that you eat lots of vegetables and fruits, which are rich in antioxidants. Stick to natural grains like quinoa or brown rice and avoid processed foods like white bread or pastries."

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I am aware that vomiting is the body's normal response to certain illnesses but here is the thing. I have emetophobia, which is a phobia of vomiting. This is not just \"oh, yeah no one likes to throw up\". This is a debilitating fear that effects a person's everyday life. Pretty much every second of everyday is spent wondering and fearing that I could possibly throw up, even though this is obviously something that happens rarely. If I ever feel sick this results in me shaking uncontrollably, I get that scared. So, I read online that when one has Norovirus for example, it is the intestines that are infected, and vomiting is just the body's useless response and does not help you get better. I wanted to know if the same goes for food poisoning. Would I be okay if I took antiemetics if I felt sick and knew that I had eaten something bad? What are the consequences of doing this? I know if that ever happens to me I will take them unless it could be deadly or something. I do plan on getting help for my phobia in the future. Until then, I will do this. I have a great deal of self control with the pills and do not take them just because I feel panicky. I have had them for a long time and have yet to take any, and will not unless I know for sure that I am sick. But I want to know this for future reference in case I need them one day. Also I think it is important I mention that I am otherwise healthy adult and have no health issues in the past. Doctor: Hi. First of all I would like to clarify that vomiting is not a useless response of the body. It is body's way of conveying that something wrong is there that needs to be corrected. For example in food poisoning the body vomits so that it throws away all the food that is in the stomach so that the body is free of toxic substance. Also, vomiting can happen in conditions other than gut related like some problem in the brain, eye, liver, pancreas, etc. And sometimes vomiting may be the only sign or clue to detect those problems. So unless the cause for vomiting is diagnosed just suppressing vomit by medication is not right. Like in food poisoning after taking anti-vomiting medicines vomit may stop but not the food poisoning which requires antibiotics. So, my advise is yes you can take antiemetics when you feel sick but you should also consult a doctor to find out what made you sick. But till you consult a doctor you can take antiemetics, no problem with that. I advise you take tablet Ondansetron 4 mg when you feel nauseous. Also as you said take a psychiatric counselling for your phobia."

Questions: 1) How and why do I have all symptoms of c8 radiculopathy confirmed by EMG but not reflective of MRI- c7/t1 normal? 2) What else if anything could cause c8 radiculopathy in last 2 digits per my imaging that would explain this medically? 3) What is your final assessment and why? To date: Undergone much PT and recieved facet injections at 2 sites: above and below ACDF. Persistent neck pain into scalpula and upper extremity unilateral hand numbness especially D4, D5. Now with new weakness in opposite hand. History/background/ diagnostics: Former ACDF at c5/6 labeled degenerative disk in mid/late 20's. Resulted in great sucess post-surgery. Several years later- accident occurs: results multiple levels damaged, cervical spondylosis. Imaging reports: MRI findings:  no cord/ vertebral lesion and multi DDD below above acdf. C4/5 herniation and degeneration and cord encroachment. C5/C6- bony overgrowth causes cord encroachment. C6/C7 herniation degeneration but without any encroachment. C7/T1- unremarkable. Myelo gram- showed small extradural lesion at C5/6 with thecal sac compression. A spur projecting from posterior border of C6, small ventral defect. EMG- (left- UE) Neuro exam: weakness ADM, APB, 1st D1. Decreased sensation digits 3,4,5 clawing in 5th digit. DTR 1+. NCV: left ulnar sensory nerve decreased conduction veloc (wrist-5th digit, 42/s) Polyphasic Volition 1st D1 and ADM. No acute radiculopathy, plexopathy, peripheral neuropathy. Final: Abnormal test concluded Chronic C8 radiculopathy. Doctor: Hi. You do have chronic C8 radiculopathy from your detailed description. The reason for mismatch between NCV / EMG findings and MRI can be explained on the basis of a pre-fixed or a post-fixed brachial plexus where in the nerve exiting the C7-T1 inter space is actually carrying nerve fibres from the space below; that will show up normal on MRI. The actual C8 fibres are going out at a space above ie C6-C7 or higher where they are getting compressed. Spur and compression exists at a higher level. The second possibility is that there is arachnoiditis but that should show up on MRI, however, I have not seen the MRI myself and have to rely on the report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The third explanation is possible injuries scarring at the time of ACDF or after less likely as you would have known the temporal sequence of symptoms. By APB you mean adductor and not abductor pollicus brevis - that is median nerve. Appearance of new symptoms and persisting neck pain afert ACDF suggests instability at another level which unfortunately can happen and is a collateral effect of fusion in spine. Get flexion extension X-rays and dynamic contrast MRI."

Doctor: Hello. Yes, I can understand that weight gain can be difficult for some people - but surely it is possible. Your wife needs to add at least 6 to 7 kg weight. You need to eat the food that you like as this will help you eat more than usual. So, you need to take the kind of food that you like for example spicy food, veg or non-veg diet, etc. The calorie intake has to be higher than what you regularly take - this also means that you need to take greater quantity of food. You need to make a list of foodstuffs that you like and stick it on your refrigerator. For example, bananas, apples, peanuts, milk, chocolates, chips, french fries, ice-cream, almonds. Also, make a list of items for lunch and dinner that you like and cook them frequently. Exercising: If you are doing any high-calorie burning exercises then you need to switch to other exercises for muscle training and less cardio workouts. Dietician: constant follow-ups with your dietician will help you with progress of weight gain - always keep a dietician in the loop. Add-on meal: start intake of one small extra meal other than your regular meals and do this consistently, over two months you will see the difference. Protein supplements: powder protein supplements available in the market needs to be taken twice daily with milk. Do this consistently to see a change. Consistency: is the key to success, so do these things regularly and only then you will see the results. Sleep: you need to sleep for at least eight hours daily for a healthy body, and you can also add on another hour if you like as you do not lose much calories while asleep. Fruits: make it a point to eat one fruit after lunch and one after dinner. They are great add-ons for good calorie intake and this is a great idea and a must. This is only a second opinion platform.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Using oral medications after seven weeks of pregnancy may lead to heavy bleeding.

The Misoprostol tablets 200 mcg into four tablets should be inserted high inside the vagina after 48 hours of tablet Mifepristone intake.

I have been having muscle fasciculations all over my body (hands, arms, feet, legs, chest wall, glutes, knees, and cheek), every day, multiple times, for about half a year. Recently, (for about two weeks) they have worsened and I twitch almost constantly every day. I have noticed that the twitches are not present when I am physically active (for example, when I go for a walk or when I do moderate exercise). But the moment I sit or lay down, they appear again. I have also noticed slight occasional pain in my arms, hands, sometimes legs and feet as well. I have had a few cramps in my feet. My hands also feel slightly weak and tired. I have not noticed, however, signs of atrophy or actual weakness (I am able to do everyday tasks with my hands, etc). I also do not have difficulty breathing or speaking. I have had a blood test done and I do not lack any minerals. Levels of my thyroid hormones are normal. I do not drink coffee and I do not smoke. I get enough hours of sleep every day and I also would not say that I am under an extreme amount of stress. I went to see a neurologist a week and a half ago who performed a quick test to examine my reflexes and strength, stated they were normal and said I probably have BFS (benign fasciculation syndrome). However, I am still worried that I might have motor neuron disease. The fasciculations are extremely annoying and I have no idea what might be causing (and worsening) them and I am also worried because of the newly acquired pain, cramping, and feeling of tiredness in my hands. Not a single day passes by without my muscles twitching. I am female, 21 years old. I do not have a family history of neuromuscular disease. I would like to know whether my symptoms are indicative of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Is it possible to get some tests or examinations that would exclude ALS? I would really like to find out the reason behind my fasciculations as they have started to interfere greatly with my peace of mind. Doctor: Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms do not seem to be related to ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Besides, at your age, this diagnosis would be exceptional. I agree with your doctor that benign fasciculation syndrome seems to be the most probable cause of your complaints, considering the fact that all your blood lab tests resulted normal. Anyway, an electromyography coupled with nerve conduction studies would help definitely exclude ALS. I would also recommend checking Vitamin D and B12 plasma levels for the possible deficiency. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. I remain at your disposal for any other questions whenever you need.

PCA (posterior cerebral artery) is one of the arteries supplying the visual pathway and its lesions usually cause visual field defects. Most of the defects will improve over time as and when the blood supply to the affected part (occipital lobe) will improve, unless of course the main trunk of the PCA is involved, which is known to cause persistent defects. The things which your father still has intact are his central vision, using which he can still read and perform most daily activities. Also his ability to move his eyes will also be working fine.

Now, coming to treatments and their results, eye movement exercises or scanning training like I mentioned in just a while ago. Incorporation of prisms into his glasses to enable seeing objects in the hemianopic field while head and eyes are straight, it can be an option in case his neck has a problem and he has problems moving his eyes. Both these treatments are given by orthoptists or optometrists. Regarding their usefulness in hemianopia, I will say that in most studies, patients usually improve and their fields come back to normal soon, so they never got enough time to train the patients with using these methods.

The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Once all the gel is absorbed, then you can apply sunscreen SPF 30 on top of it for the full face. Use the sunscreen every four hours, because sunscreen protects skin from UV rays for four hours once applied, you need to apply repeatedly every four hours for maximum benefit.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have seen the picture attached and it indicates that you could have contracted vaginal candidiasis infection from your partner which is a fungal infection (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Ideally, this shall require a course anti-fungal vaginal pessary for six days to be placed intra-vaginally and also oral antibiotics course considering burning micturition which indicates a secondary urinary tract infection. The itching per vaginum and thick curdy vaginal discharge almost confirm the diagnosis, though the gold standard remains growth of fungus on sabourard's medium post-high vaginal swab culture evaluation. If you cannot afford to see a doctor or buy medicines, then the best thing which can be done in the meantime is at least use of alkaline vaginal wash to clean the intra-vaginal area at least thrice a day (V-Wash) to reduce fungal infection and also to increase citrus fruit intake and water to alkalinise the urine and allow natural cleansing of infection, as much as possible. If the symptoms are not relieved in the next 48 hours, then you may require treatment with antibiotics and antifungals."

I have been prescribed multiple antibiotics and they only work whilst I am taking them and after that, the infection comes right back. After doing some research I came across the term biofilms and truly believe I may have a biofilm in my vaginal wall preventing me from curing this horrible infection. I understand antibiotics and other methods are unlikely to cure BV completely if there is an underlying issue such as a biofilm. I am also aware of the fact that biofilm can make bacterial vaginosis reoccur which is what keeps happening to me. It comes right back after taking anything for it. If this is the case what do you advise to get rid of this? I am willing to try anything. Doctor: Hi. Biofilms are sticking of bacteria or infection that remains in the wall of the vagina and cause recurrence of infection. Vagina has its specific pH and it is maintained by bacteria lactobacilli that are normal flora of the vagina. Disbalance of pH occurring by this bacteria has less proportion in comparison to other infective organisms. You have taken treatment many times but this infection recurs due to effect on your normal flora by medications recurrently. My advice to you is to have some natural approach to the problem and less exposure to the medications recurrently to normal flora as it is affecting normal flora of the vagina. Have sitz baths (sit in warm water to relief irritation). Have soft comfortable undergarments, strict hygiene. Use only clean water locally. No products use of any kind. Try to use condoms for some time to reduce transmission of sexually transmitted disease.

It is usually high in case of hemochromatosis in which iron overload occurs. But serum ferritin is within range and not elevated. Serum ferritin reflects iron store if it is within limit like in your case than not suggestive towards iron overload. So your elevated transferrin saturation finding can be non-specific.

He told me that I have liver enlargement and told me some medical tests and ultrasound. Then I found liver enlarged, high cholesterol, and some other issues. I used to drink alcohol for four years very much, then moderate. I started smoking eight years back. I masturbate a lot, which I think make my body weak. I tried to control very much but I think I am addicted to it now. I have strong will power but my strong urge and anxiety lead again towards it. I used my type multivitamin for some time which includes Revital mainly. I used to drink water a lot nearly 6 to 7 liters daily. A few months back, I came to know my vitamin D is also low. I am a vegetarian. I have multiple kidney stones (5 to 6) in both sides. This is the fourth time of formation. In the LFT test, OT and PT are very high. Please prescribe some medicine for fatty liver, cholesterol and other problems you find from my history and blood test. Doctor: Hi. You need to modify your diet and lifestyle consistently and avoid all medicines and foods which can potentially damage the liver. You need to be on a diet high in protein and low in fat or carbohydrates. You should have regular physical activity. Regarding medicines, I need to see the liver function tests to comment. Can you give the exact SGOT and SGPT values?"

PC exercises (pubococcygeus muscle) are performed basically to improve the sexual performance in men, to delay the ejaculation. To locate PC muscle, it is located in the perineum area behind the scrotum and in front of the anus. It is deep to skin and soft tissue, and urethra passes through this muscle. Hence contraction of this muscle helps to delay ejaculation by compressing urethra. The exercises for the PC muscles includes sitting with a straight back, both hands on lap. Squeeze in the anus as if trying to hold bowel while defecating. Hold and count to 10 and then slowly release the muscle. Do this for 6 to 10 times per sitting. Every day you can have 4 to 5 such sittings. While passing urine, what you can do is hold urine for 1 to 2 seconds, then, pass it, then again hold. This hold-pass can be done 3 to 4 times every time you go for a pee. Both these measures help in strengthening the PC muscle. All you need is to have patience. It will need time to show results."

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am a 65-year-old white male and tested negative for HIV 1 and 2 in a one-time test three to four years ago. I am not sure if it was a third or fourth generation test. I tested negative with a fourth generation test four months back because I thought I might be having some symptoms. And I remembered the flu-like illness about six months after exposure. I weighed 204 kg three months back and now I weigh 191 kg. I have worried a lot (pacing the floor, sleep loss) for past five months, took Paxil, and realized my worry could account for some weight loss. Shortly, after the test, I had the following symptoms:  I started having a small patch of 8 to 10 pinpoint sized pink-light red dots under the skin of my left wrist that have been there for two to three weeks. I also had a smooth, flat spot about 3/8 inch in diameter that appeared on the back of my right hand about a week ago, that has now faded to a pinkish brown. I have read about Kaposi sarcoma being a definer of AIDS, but do not understand how that could happen with a non-reactive fourth generation test four months back. Three months back, I had sinus type headaches multiple times that would sometimes be severe. After three rounds of antibiotics and a CT scan two months back that showed shadowing in a sinus, my ENT doctor just told me this week that there is something in my sphenoid sinus. He is treating it with a rinse for inflammation for three weeks before I see him again. I have had blood in my mucous from my nose for past three months. It dries out in my nose and causes blood almost every time I pick at it. The ENT doctor said that the lining of my nose had been worn down from this, but did not seem concerned about it. I do mess with it a lot, and blow my nose a lot. My PSA elevated quickly in the last six months, going from 1.2 to 3.5. A biopsy two months back showed an early cancer in one of the 12 regions biopsied. I had a lithotripsy on an 8 mm kidney stone this month and I am still passing dark urine. I was told that I do have several small stones still in each kidney. I have had multiple stones over the years. I have a swelling sensation all the way around my waist down into my groin at times that has been there for about two months, but no noticeable swelling. Several doctors have felt in my abdomen and detected nothing abnormal. A CT scan with no contrast 10 days ago showed no abnormalities other than a little swelling in the right kidney where the 8 mm stone was blocking the passage into the ureter. A CT with contrast five months back was normal except for showing stones. But I have microscopic blood in my urine since then.  My vital signs have consistently been normal for past five months, including temperature, BP and oxygen. I know I am getting old and some of these symptoms happen with age. But it is driving me crazy that so much has happened since my negative fourth generation test which is supposed to detect antibodies may not be conclusive after three to four years of exposure. I had Zoloft 100 mg daily earlier but currently, on Paxil 40 mg and Propranolol 60 mg daily. After nearly four years of exposure and a negative antibody test four months back, would that test have detected antibodies if I were in a stage of HIV or AIDS? Do you think it was conclusive? Or is there another test I should have done? I have read about an HIV RNA test, but it says early detection. I understand that it detects more than the antibodies. What are your thoughts on my next step? Doctor: Hi. Your test done before four months is certainly conclusive and final. A three months intervening period/window period between risk exposure and a fourth generation HIV screening test is good enough for it to be considered conclusive. 95 % of those infected with HIV will have detectable antibodies by four weeks and by 12 weeks, or three months 100 % of HIV infected individual will have detectable antibodies. Antibodies once formed will remain detectable by screening tests. In fact, antibody based HIV screening tests are the gold standard tests for the diagnosis of infection whereas an HIV RNA PCR test is more commonly utilized as a measure of response to antiretroviral therapy in HIV AIDS patients rather than as a diagnostic or screening test.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I am a 22 year old female. I have a dusky skin that is brown skin. I want to become fair. Can I use Kojivit gel? Or any other dermoatology cream can I use? My hands are also brown in color and full of tan. Do you suggest any creams to get fair? I want to become fair as my marriage is going to get fixed by next year. Please suggest me some creams, so that it should not show any side effects. Also, how long I should use it? If I use anything, then will it have any effect in case of pregnancy, etc? Please help me. Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/dermatologist"

Even a small fissure can be really painful as it causes a spasm of the anal opening. It heals slowly, as it gets irritated repeatedly during the bowel movement. You might even notice blood on the toilet paper or in the stools. I suggest you get examined by a physician. Warm water sitz bath, which involves sitting in a tub warm of water, to soak the painful anal area, helps a lot in this condition. The other recommendation is to take a high fiber diet. Your physician, after an examination, can prescribe you analgesics and a stool softener. Hold off on more anal sex until you recover from the current problem. Hope your query is answered.

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

It crusts over, then falls off, and then weeps or bleeds. Very sore and itchy. Doctor: Hi. I have gone through your case (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Right now, your lesion has taken the shape of a scar. The diagnosis of carcinoma can only be made on biopsy and you are already on a dermatologist's list. So, do not panic and be patient. In my opinion, it is just a local spread which has occurred during the last two weeks. And this is because, whenever we itch harshly, any lesion can ooze and form the crust which is beyond the lesion margin as blood spreads easily and crust is dried up blood and pus. So, it seems to you that it is spreading. However, from the above explanation, the diagnosis of carcinoma cannot be excluded as it is based only on biopsy. Be patient. Suggest you keep on applying Sudocrem (Antiseptic cream). Do not apply anything else until you see a doctor. Moreover, it does not look to be an aggressive lesion, so relax.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Though some more details about the symptoms are required, however, I may say that the patient is suffering from bipolar affective disorder. As the name suggests it has two poles. The first pole is depression which is very common where the patient feels sad, has decreased energy and pleasure and can have suicidal ideas. The second pole being mania where the patient appears high, they talk continuously, talk high things about themselves, highly energetic.

Now, I am slightly nervous because I may get married soon and I wanted to know if everything is fine. Doctor: Hi. The foreskin retracts itself on erection and if you had no problem for masturbation, there will not be any problem for sex as well. Foreskin never comes in the way of sex. Hence, you need not be anxious. Basically, the foreskin slides easily during sex and one should not forget to pull it back after sex.

I feel there is a need for cardiac MRI to gain a current picture or status of my disease. I feel occasional chest tightness and dull pain but I also have acid reflux disease. What could it be? Doctor: Hello. You have stable ischemic heart disease for the last three years. You are taking medicines and want to know about the heart in detail for which you want cardiac MRI. You have 50 % blockage in the major coronary artery. As far as your heart condition is concerned, it only needs detailed echocardiography to know the function of left and right side of heart, structures of valves and other structures. MRI is only done in case when comprehensive echocardiography is unable to provide information which cardiologist wants to know. Stable ischemic heart disease is treated with lifestyle modifications and medicines. If signs or symptoms remain stable, these are continued without intervention such as angioplasty or bypass. When symptoms are out of control despite maximum medicines and lifestyle modifications, then revascularization is done. I hope your cardiologist got complete information about your heart from angiography and echocardiography. So there is no need of cardiac MRI. MRI is required when there is congenital heart disease, any infiltrative disease whose complete details are not evident on echocardiography. I am sorry I could not promote your views about having cardiac MRI, yet you may ask your cardiologist to tell you the benefits of cardiac MRI over echocardiography, and then you may ask about undergoing MRI in your case. Remember, in most patients, MRI does not provide any additional information that may aid in planning medicines and treatment plan beyond echocardiography and angiography. I would advise you to adhere to a healthy lifestyle, medications, and follow the advice of your cardiologist. Moreover, you may send your reports to me, so that I may guide you more accordingly."

There is endometrial thickening evident but there is no apparent evidence of any early gestational sac in situ which would indicate any pregnancy.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am seriously facing acne pimples problem. Sometimes they occur on my face when I masturbate. If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result. Is it okay to continue this? Doctor: Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

Please provide me more detailed history such as preterm or full term, birth weight, normal delivery or LSCS. How is her weight? Is she gaining weight and let me know more about family history or any other in the family suffering from SMA (spinal muscular atrophy). SMA is confirmed only by Genetic testing or by muscle study. There are many types of SMA some of them develop symptoms later in life and a few develop in early life.

However, as the recovery period can be a lengthy one, you may hold off on surgery for a few months provided the discharge from the sinus is not bothering you too much and is not painful. Whilst you decide on when to get it operated, you should continue to maintain local hygiene, keep the area as dry as possible, and remove any hair in the area. That being said, the longer you leave it, the more problematic it might become due to infection, and worsening of the sinus. If you do not wish to undergo a surgical procedure, there is the option of opting for laser treatment or trying various creams. I should warn you that either of these is less successful than treating it surgically. Sinogram. Maintain local hygiene, Shave hair from the region. Keep the area dry."

I have no chest pain or throat discomfort. No weight loss. Whenever my stomach is gassy, I cough. Please help. I have smoked for five years. What is my cancer chance? Doctor: Hello. As you said that you have been smoking for five years and now have cough with clear mucus expectoration, it is most likely due to bronchitis. It is very common to have cough if you smoke more than five cigarettes per day. Also, because of cold weather, it gets aggravated and takes longer to heal. So, better is to stop smoking as you did rightly and take a good expectorant like syrup TusQ-X 10 ml (combination of Ambroxol, Guaifenesin, and Terbutaline) three times a day. Continue with salt water gargles and steam. It will help to loosen and liquefy the cough. If there is no relief even after seven days, better get your chest X-ray done from your family doctor and get treated accordingly. Usually smoking for five years at this age does not cause lung cancer but you should stop smoking. Smokers' cough because of bronchitis is very common.

If it is non-painful and if the x-ray reveals that the infection has not touched the pulp, you can go for a filling. It is advised that you see the dentist as soon as possible because once the infection spreads deep into the roots, even a root canal treatment would not be possible.  In that kind of a scenario, removal of the tooth becomes the only option. Basic procedures cost is less. The expenses of treatment increases if not treated in time.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

As he had a heart attack, first priority is revascularization of angioplasty or bypass surgery. If this is done and heart function improves, then it will be good. In right bundle branch block, there is very little benefit of CRT (cardiac resynchronization therapy). If revascularization is not possible, then maximum medical therapy is best. Yes, ICD (implantable cadioverter defibrillator) is indicated. It should be considered once the patient is out of the acute episode and is stabilized.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I was getting eczema on my hands and feet with the sun at the beach (tiny tiny little itchy blisters), but my forearms and calves start to itch with a very slight rash. I was told I essentially had very dry skin. He was not even going to order a blood test but did it just to make sure of blood count. I showed him a picture of a slight rash. The ANA then tested positive. I have to go see a rheumatologist now. I do not have any other symptoms of joint pain, etc. I am pretty healthy. I work out five times a week. I take Atorvastatin for cholesterol, Baby Asprin, Ezetimibe, and Vitamin D. I also have a vitamin D deficiency. I also had a physical four months ago and everything else was fine with the blood work. Everyone told me not to worry, that there are a lot of false positives. I can have an early stage of something and it needs to be monitored. But what am I most likely realistically looking at? How quickly does this get assigned? Doctor: Hello. According to history it looks more like the skin is the only one troubling you. I would like to ask you a few more queries. Did your rash resolve after the sun exposure was removed? Do you experience it on a daily basis when exposed to the sun or was it just due to prolonged exposure? How about your other blood test like complete blood count, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and liver function test.  Yes, it is true that ANA (antinuclear antibody) can be a false positive in a lot of people. But we need to be sure that it is not the start of a disease. So only ANA does not give us answers. We need to see if it is causing inflammation in the blood which will be clear from other tests. As per history, it sounds more like a polymorphous light eruption which usually should improve itself. But yes, if your skin is sensitive you should avoid getting prolonged exposures like tat as they can be harmful to the skin."

I was evaluated and diagnosed as a case of IBS. I am uploading my complete details. Please find attachment. Doctor: Hi. I reviewed all your medical reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and I can say as follows: First of all, you need to be examined with upper endoscopy and colonoscopy plus abdominal ultrasound. Your symptoms may be related with Gerd and hiatal hernia or gastritis, stomach ulcer. In the meantime, I would suggest using PPI's (proton pump inhibitors) and antacid to improve your symptoms.

If you do not have any pain or bleeding per vaginal than there is more chance that with medicines pregnancy has more chance for growth. Irregular gestational sac sometimes can be due to uterine contraction which can be present throughout pregnancy. If this is the case then there is more chance that pregnancy is good and there is more chance for growth. One more reason of irregular sac is also a sign of early abortion. But we can do only these things. Do take complete bed rest. Do minimum activity. Take small frequent meals. Take micronized Progesterone for 2 to 4 times a day 200 mg, Folic acid tablet, and Thiamine or multivitamin tablet. All these will be helpful for growing pregnancy.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I hope she is growing well and must have attained her normal mile stones for the age. No medication is required to make her sleep. You can continue breast feeding up to 2 years of age as recommended. Develop a routine for food and breast feeding. At this stage, baby needs four meals and three to four times breast feeding. Make an alternate, give breast feeding when she wakes up, after two to three hours give breakfast, like that. If she sleeps for good hours during day time then, you need to make her engage in some play to reduce day time sleep. It will take time, but slowly, she will develop a proper cycle.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am an IV drug user, street-level Fentanyl and Carfentanyl specifically and I am getting big deep scabby like sores all over my arms where I am using IV. Now I am noticing electrical currents shocking my arms both at exactly the same time, especially when I take deeper breaths I have noticed. Doctor: Hello. I am really sorry to know that you are an IV drug user. I hope you will start quitting the drug, life is a beautiful gift, so do not throw it away like this. Get helped by family or friends or even by a specialist to be drug-free. You deserve a better life, but not like this. The problems with deep breathing electrical currents when injecting drug is due to drugs injected. Perhaps the dose was higher than normal or not injected inside the vein. Or injection speed was fast, in other words, is due to the drug injected. Plus, sores all over your arms are infected, need to keep well clean, wash with warm water and soap, rinse well, dry well. Then, apply alcoholic swab, plus Betadine on the sores followed by triple antibiotic ointment. If no improvement, you should consult further with your physician."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am an 18-year-old female and for about nine months I have had severe jaw pain and it hurts when I chew and sometimes it pops and locks into place. My parents brought it up to my dentist about two months after it started but without looking at my jaw or even asking me about it they said it is growing pain and they will not worry about it unless I still have it when I am little older but I am also getting way more headaches than I used to and sometimes the pain is so severe it makes me cry. Sometimes, it is getting way worse to the point where I suddenly have to stop talking sometimes because my jaw locks in place. Please help. Doctor: Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. Lock jaw, clicking sound are one of the classic symptoms of TMJ disorders. TMJ stands for temperomandibular joint which is the joint that moves the mandible up, down and sideways. If there is a lack of cushion effect, the mandible head slides through the other bone surface giving this kind of sounds and pain. It cannot be a growing thing. If this continues, it might lead to loss of bone in the joint or even fracture at some point. Addressing at an early stage can be of massive help. You should be given a custom fabricated mouth guard to be worn daily specially during night times. This mouth guard is a flexible one which can be used easily by yourself and maintained clean. This is the initial treatment approach in such a scenario. You will definitely see a huge difference in 3 to 6 months. I request you to visit the dentist again and stress in your complaint so that the right treatment approach is given to you. TMJ X-ray. Mouth guard fabrication. 1.Avoid chewing in one side. 2.Also, avoid biting hard food."

A hernia is a term used to describe any abnormal protrusion of any organ (most commonly bowel) from the cavity that covers the organ. First of all, what do you mean by a hernia? A hernia can be inguinal or femoral or hiatal, obturator, etc. You have not described the site of the hernia. But you are worried regarding your sexual function, so I am guessing you had an inguinal hernia with extension into the scrotal sac. Rest assured, if the hernia has been repaired properly by an experienced surgeon, it can never affect your reproductive health."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

For your mother, we need to know some health information like her history of blood pressure, recent surgery, diabetes, or any history of blood disorders. For implants, they are actually of two types. 1. Basic implants. 2. Advanced implants. Both are imported implants, basic and advanced. Well, the cost of a basic implant starts from 10 k per implant, and advance implant starts with 25 k per implant. Apart from this, there will be a separate package of teeth that she will choose. The price can differ according to region and reputation and experience of clinician and material costs. For her basic implant will be best. All implants have warranty mostly for the same duration. The treatment will take a long time. In the first stage, we operate mouth to place the implant (as your mother has nine missing teeth). Then there will be a gap for healing bone for three months. After three months, the impression will be taken, and then fixed teeth will be placed in about a month. For a better and economical option, you can opt for fixed dentures that will exactly look like original teeth and will be placed in a month. I wish your mother good health and happiness.

This sound is really causing me to panic ; last night I has 3 anxiety attacks because of it and I took 50mg Sressam tablet but it did not work. I still have the ringing in my ears today and I've taken another stressam about 1 and a half hours ago but it's not seeming to work. I'm afraid I might have an anxiety attack again tonight because of it. I've recently been placed on Acnetret for my Ance (7 days ago) but my Dr told me to stop it for a few days because I have been experiencing extreme back pain which I am still experiencing right now. I have been off the tablets for about 2 or 3 days and I dont know If this could be causing the high pitch (silence sort of noise) in my ears. Its causing extreme anxiety and unfortunately all Dr's rooms are closed right now.   Age: 15  Male 176 cm  164.8 kg Doctor: Hello First of all, please know that ringing sensation is very common and prevalent. There are many suspected causes for ringing sensation in the ear. The most common ones being - wax impinging on the ear-drum, sudden, loud noise, moving into a quiet room from a noisy environment and so on. You say it started after a bath. Even water, soap, hair follicles within your ear, when come in contact with the ear-drum can cause such ringing sensation, although for a short duration. This might have even attracted your attention to a symptom which might have been there even before, but was not noticeable. Sometimes, the medications you are on also can cause this ringing sensation. To be honest, there are lots of causes but no sure way of evaluating it. So, my suggestion - try diverting your thoughts away from this and try concentrating on some other work. When your thoughts are deeply immersed in something else, you will realise that you can hear the ringing sensation only if you think about it. You can also listen to music with ear-phones, with the volume of your device between 30-60% to get your mind off it. But please don\u2019t do this all day. Give a gap of atleast an hour after listening for about 30 minutes. Also, it will probably not bother you when you are involved in a conversation with somebody, keeping your mind off it. All said, there are certain rare causes also, which require systematic treatment, but I wouldn\u2019t want you to worry about them right away. This symptom of yours has started all of a sudden and in all probability might disappear spontaneously as well. Do not get anxious reading about all the causes of ringing sensation on the Internet as it is bound to frighten you. Try the above methods and tell me after 24 hours if there was any improvement at all."

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

The impact of walking and running has been very painful. I cannot walk up a steep hill or even jog downhill or run without getting shin splints. I am getting severe shin and ankle pain for many days. Even if it is only five minutes of jogging downhill the impact is severe. I have tried exercise such as running on a treadmill and then my ankles became very red, itchy and visibly swollen. I have never had visible calf muscles and I am a thin build. I have been active most of my life although I have never been able to build natural muscle in the bottom half of my legs. Most season of the year I get cold. My ankles and feet will stay cold and no blankets or socks can warm them up as the cold feeling is internal. In winter it becomes very painful and I become immobile because of the feeling. My ankles and feet feel like a bag of ice. I have had other problems like pinched nerves in my neck and severe tension headaches.

No need to get panicky over the dog bite. You are fine. Rabies testing on humans is performed on samples of saliva, serum. Saliva can be tested by virus isolation or reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum and spinal fluid are tested for antibodies to rabies virus. In animals suspected of rabies, they have to be killed and their brains are examined for the presence of this rabies virus. Rabies is usually fatal. So the best thing is prevention.

As you said you always had regular cycles, just wanted to know if your previous period was on time and had a normal pattern of bleeding or was it scanty. Also, whether you are a sexually active individual, and if so whether any chances of pregnancy could be there? If there is any such doubt, it would be advisable to take a home pregnancy test. Sometimes the scanty flow of implantation hemorrhage could be confused with a normal period and the actual bleeding could be a sign of threatened miscarriage. If pregnancy is ruled out (by checking urine pregnancy test or if not sexually active), the hormonal disturbances of thyroid or prolactin hormones, and sometimes lifestyle-related problem that is PCOS also can cause such irregularities in periods. Also, stress can be one of the reason for hormonal changes and thus causing disturbances in menstrual patterns. Basically, this is suggestive of anovulatory cycles. So to find out these, you need to take certain blood tests. I would like to know if you had any recent weight loss, or do you face frequent acne and unwanted facial hair growth problems, any headaches or visual problems? These symptoms may provide some clues to the underlying problem which is causing a delay in periods for you. Please revert back to me with the necessary details for discussion, so as to find the appropriate cause for your problem and start the necessary treatment to control the bleeding.

You can stop Lonazep if you have daytime sleepiness. Lonazep is used for sleep disturbance. And even depression causes sleepiness and tiredness. It will improve as medication starts to take effect. Do daily exercise for 30 to 40 minutes, do meditation for 15 minutes, do what you like for 20 minutes like give time for your hobbies, read good books, painting, write journals, take good healthy foods, avoid junk food, get sound sleep for seven to eight hours, spend quality time with family and friends.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I am concerned that these very light periods indicate abnormal endometrial function or some other abnormality that may affect my fertility, and I\u2019d be very grateful for any insight you have.  Thanks,  Roisin Doctor: Hello doc Welcome to icliniq i will explain you a little bit how estrogen progestin contraceptive and a levonogestrel DIU effect fertility : Combination of OCs suppress basal FSh and LH They diminish the ability of pituitary gland to synthesize gonadotropins when it is stimulated by hipothalamic GnRH.Ovarian follicles do not mature ,little estradiol is produced and there is no midcycle LH surge .Ovulation does not occur ,corpus luteum does not form and progesteron is not produced .This means that interferes ,and block negative and positive feedback of HHO axis . Also the IUD (Mirena ) which contains levonogestrel reduced the FSH ,there is less follicular activity ,less estradiol production and no LH surge also cause an local inflamatory rection inside the uterine cavity . The blocage of HHO is revesible ,as far as you interrup the coc pills,the estrogen and progesteron levels will fall (may be it will take a few months) ,so HHO axis will start to functionate normally ,and the cycle will be ovulatory again . So the change of the quantity of bleeding isn't so inportant ,if your cycle arw ovulatory . Only if you have amenorrhea more than 6 months after discontinuation of OCs pills shoyud undergo evaluation. So it' normal to experience change of menstrual cycle after IUD .

For the past eight months, my sex drive is non-existent. I also have no morning erections. Factors that play a role are that I broke up with my wife and also eight months ago, I had serious accessory nerve operation that failed to fix my trapezius palsy, but I think these areas are physically too far apart. But maybe depression? I have not been able to think myself to be turned on. I have tried Zinc, Magnesium ZMA vitamin supplements which seemed to help for one week and I got hard morning erections. However, it stopped working. I have also tried Ginseng which does work as well as Tadalafil prescription works too. I can stimulate the penis with no medication too and ejaculate, but I usually have to look at porn (which I do not do often do because I have no libido, whatsoever). I have failed to have sex with three girls now because of lack of desire. I want to physically get it up, but it does not get up. I have ED, and I simply cannot get it up to beautiful women which is horrible. I have slight pain in both testicles which is I think because I have not masturbated. Feels like blue balls which are there when a man gets turned on but does not cum, so it hurts a little. No lumps are there on or in the testicles or anywhere else. No STDs of which I am sure because I had only five partners of which my ex-wife now was for last four years. All were protected sex. All tests came back normal. Only ECG said signs of hypertrophy but compared to ECG three years ago, not with any significant change so I doubt this is a reason. Also, note that the testosterone levels are fine. I usually get my eight hours of sleep but this may be because of sleep apnea. I never feel too rested. Doctor: Hello. Relax and do not worry. ED (erectile dysfunction) can be because of mainly two causes: Basically, we need to differentiate between the two as treatments for both are different. Your reports are fine (attachment removed to protect patient identity) They do not suggest any hormonal problems. I would like to have you one more test which is penile doppler with vasoactive substance injection (Papaverine). This will test whether the flow of blood in your penis is adequate or not. I feel you have a psychological cause because of your relationship with your wife and other stressful events. Moreover, it has formed a loop as now you are in the fear that every time it will not erect. So, I feel it is basically a psychological cause.

Since being removed, my nipples have been super hard and sore all the time. I just feel off. Could I be pregnant? Or is it just the left over birth control? Before three months, I had a pregnancy test while on birth control and it was negative. The period I had while on it was light pink, then brown and then red. It only showed when I wiped. Doctor: Hi. Nexplanon is a progesterone having implant (Etonogestrel). After insertion, the menses can be irregular or even stopped for 6 months to almost 1 year. But, if you had not gotten your period since last three months and you had regular intercourse, then you should do a urine pregnancy test first. If it is negative, then it is delayed menses due to Nexplanon. Periods become irregular because your normal hormonal cycle of your body gets disturbed due to Nexplanon (outside hormones) like drugs. And, your body takes time for recovering from this disturbance to a normal cycle. It takes time according to your body type, levels of hormone secretion in your body, tissue responses of your body and many other things. Some are known and some are not. Nipple hardness is also due to this disturbance. Because, breast tissue and your uterus are the two major organs, which gets maximum effect due to hormones according to their levels. Other than this, the total body has effects of hormones, but not every single are appreciated or being experienced. Mood swing is also related to one of these. The bleeding for three months after Nexplanon may be because it does either more or less than what is required for your body. In both cases, you may have bleeding. But, it is more likely due to very low doses. You can take oral contraceptive pills for 1 or 2 months and then stop it to see whether periods get started regularly or not. Also, drink more water.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am a 42-year-old female, in good health aside from anxiety (currently taking 5 mg Citalopram). A month ago, I suddenly experienced muscle twitching all over both legs and this went on for two weeks. I took magnesium and it subsided and has not really returned except for an occasional twitch here or there. I am extremely concerned because over the course of the month, I have had three episodes where I forgot how to swallow for a second. It was scary and now I am afraid I have the onset of ALS. I do also have a long time habit of throat clearing. Although I have not experienced any muscle weakness, are those symptoms indicative of ALS? Doctor: Hi. Twitching of muscles can be due to anxiety as well as Citalopram. What is important is that you mention having them before initiating Citalopram. So it is unlikely to be due to the drug. If it is occasional then you should rather not bother yourself because twitching intermittently is there even in an otherwise healthy individuals. What is important is your sensation of forgetting to swallow. This is drug-induced akathisia or abnormal movement. Citalopram is known to have abnormal sensation restricted to tongue also. Hence, if you feel that this is bothersome and progressing then you may change the medicine. But my experience is that 5 mg is a very small dose to be causing side effects. These symptoms are due to your anxiety. As twitching was there before too and improved with magnesium. Your habit of throat clearing along with anxiety may be the cause of your feeling of forgetting how to swallow. I have personally seen people having this because of acidity with reflux, people with a habit of gulping food, etc., in many simple life situations. I would rather like you to assure and to get relaxed with behavioral techniques and meditation if possible. If it still persists then change of medications may be considered. As far as ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is considered I can only say that it requires NCV (nerve conduction test), EMG (electromyography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) for definitive diagnosis. About 5% have a family history. But one should get thyroid function, parathormone and Vitamin B1 tested. Because these are common and mimics ALS. Twitching if reduced should be a reassurance against ALS. I hope this helps."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Ramipril was causing dry cough and was nanaging until recently. But now cough becomes very sensitive due to current COVID 19 situation and so visited another clinic for an opinion and the doctor changed to Concor 5mg and Amaasc 5 mg at least for three months until the current situation improves as constant cough due to Ramipril concerns me and others as well. Doctor asked to reduce the dose of Rosuvastatin or to take on alternate days. My question, Are the prescribed medicines safe? I read Concor does affect the sexual drive to some extent? Although with my age not so active, but with Ramipril there was no issue on this ground. Even otherwise will the combination prescribe now benefit? Doctor: Hi. I read and understand that your concern is about the side effects of the newly prescribed drugs. Reduction of sexual drive is one of the side effects of beta-blocker group of drugs. Concor contains Bisoprolol which is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The systemic side effects of cardioselective beta-blockers are less compared to the general beta-blockers. So the effect of Concor on the sexual drive would not be that significant to affect your usual life. And the combination prescribed is safe to take. There are no significant drug-drug interactions between these group of drugs."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, Three weeks ago we had a problem with water in my apartment, so the owner gave us a second apartment to use the water while they fix the issue. What happened is that day I felt the urge to masturbate but what happened on that day is that I felt ashamed because I felt that I really dirtied the place (because of masturbation) and that the apartment was not mine for me to use it that way. That made me feel shame and telling someone did not solve it. I feel this deep shame whenever I meet anyone because I feel like nobody has ever done this in such a way in such a sequence by sort of taking advantage of the place you were given just because you did not have water which makes what I did bad and I felt if someone knew about it then they would laugh at how I took advantage of this apartment situation, etc. I felt that if I stayed there then maybe it would be something common and no shame would be present. I still have the feeling that because it is scarce that I did something bad and that I am hiding that whenever I speak to any person and that they do not know I did that because it is a taboo. P.S: I do not have problem with that act, I just feel ashamed from the situation of which it happened that is uncommon and cannot shake off remembering what happened and feeling ashamed as a person in my all to day life. Since I started discovering these sexual traits as a child, I always regarded semen as an unclean thing and tend to overwash after masturbation and regard masturbation as something that everyone hides, therefore, it is bad.  What can I do to get it out of my head and not feel shame anymore? Because the thing that is bothering me is how it happened like nobody gets to get another apartment and do such a thing and that is always messing with my mind. I tried accepting it but it is just not going away and causing me heavy stress and interrupting my everyday life and happiness. Doctor: Hello. It looks like you are having obsessive thoughts, as you also have history of OCD. I would suggest you to talk to a therapist and take cognitive behavioral therapy. It would be helpful for you to have control over your obsession. You can find a local therapist or we can start counseling therapy session online via video consultation."

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, Can I grow any longer? I am 16 years old. My parents' heights are about 5'5\" and 5'0\" and my sister is 5'1\". I had my knee's and hand's X-ray and both of them are fused. Since then I have grown only an inch or two. I was 5'1\" back then now I am like 5'3\" or 5'4\" in morning. I have been taking Vitamin D supplements along with Vitamin A, Zinc, and Magnesium. Doing yoga on regular basis and body weight exercises like push-ups, chin-ups, pull-ups, and dips. I have been sprinting and skipping rope and my diet is full of protein (junk food only on Sunday). I do not know how I stunted my growth. Maybe late night cravings with junk food and also bad sleeping habits might have contributed to my short stature. I have heard men do not stop growing until the age of 21 or 25. When I compare my legs to my friends we have the same length, maybe an inch or two difference but they are like 5'10\" or 5'11\". I have hairs on my legs from a year an a half. I have little facial hair (not too much). My genitals are not fully grown but I have pubic hairs. I want to be at least 5'7\" or 5'8\". Since taking HGH will not affect my legs (growth plates ossified) but will it affect my spine? I feel like my torso is very short compared to my dad too. If I can get prescription for HGH, will taking it lengthen my spine or harden the long bones which will result in growth (2-3 inches)? I have been looking for answers online but I found none relating to spine growth from HGH. As far as I have seen in gigantism most of their height comes from their torso. If I take HGH will my spine grow like theirs too? Since I am only 16 and not fully matured. I do not want to do the leg lengthening surgery (will affect my athletic performance) and also I forgot to mention I have never got a growth spurt in my life. All my height growth has been gradual. When I looked at my friends after a long summer they shot up to 4 to 5 inches. Whereas I stayed the same. Please tell me if I can do anything regarding my height. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it appears that you would like to grow taller. Well, your predicted height according to your parents' height is expected to be 5'5\". Even if your X-ray shows that your bones have fused it is still possible for you to grow naturally taller until 21 years of age. Human growth hormone does not work unless a person is actually deficient in it. And, no you cannot have a targeted growth by taking it. You might cause more harm to your self than good. Your habits are good but you need to start doing more of cardiovascular exercises like cycling and playing sports like basketball which involves jumping and stretching more. Every single person is different as to when they can achieve a growth spurt. Of prime importance is proper sleep as natural secretion of growth hormone occurs at night time.So, be positive and keep up the good work.

The pain if persists after 3 to 4 days can be due to many reasons including some infections also. It may be due to the large unhealed wound because the third molar generally requires a surgical intervention or it may be because of a dry socket (but that is highly unlikely as you mentioned you have followed the instructions properly, but it cannot be ruled out completely). I would like you to have a visit to the same dentist for the said tooth socket in order to rule out ay other cause. I would also advise you to follow the same instructions given by the dentist after the teeth removal for the coming five days again. Maintain good oral hygiene and avoid touching the injury site with finger or tongue."

Also, I am feeling sleepy during the day. Since I never felt like this before my periods earlier, I am worried I could be pregnant. Doctor: Hello. The symptoms you are describing could also be due to the premenstrual syndrome (PMS) which is caused by the influence of the progesterone hormone post-ovulation which can mimic pregnancy to a small extent. Although you had intercourse around the time of your ovulation, as you had a protected intercourse the chances of getting pregnant is less. So, if there is a delay in your periods, the best thing to do is take a urine pregnancy test with an early morning urine sample. That will clear off your doubts if you are pregnant or not. If it is negative, you can stay assured. And if it is positive, you can take necessary action accordingly.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

You have to continue drops which have been prescribed by your doctor that is perfect drops only. So no need to worry. It can take three to six months or sometimes one year to resolve. Just continue drops which you are using right now both you should use it daily for at least a month. Then you can taper the frequency of it and slowly you can stop it. Slowly your vision will improve as lesions on the cornea will get resolved."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,  I am 44 years old. I consumed alcohol (whiskey) last Friday, about 20 ounces over 5 hours. I do not drink often. I had my dinner after taking alcohol. The next day morning I vomited, it was yellow and no food. An hour later, I vomited again, it was green and no food. I have no diarrhea, no jaundice, no bloodshot eyes. Three days later, I have no appetite. Still, I am eating and having bowel movements. I am having an unpleasant odor in my underarms and having mild sweat constantly. Did I permanantly damaged my liver? Doctor: Hello. You consumed a lot of alcohol, very close to the toxic level, and hence you have developed alcohol-induced gastritis. You cannot permanently damage your liver by binge drinking once. However, if you keep drinking frequently, you will develop fatty liver which later on will progress to liver cirrhosis. So try to reduce your drink in the future. This recovery will take a few days. I will advise you the following medicines. If you do not get better in two to three days, then you can consult a doctor and he will suggest some tests. 1) Pan 40 (Pantoprazole), one tablet in the morning before breakfast for seven days. 2) Sucralfate syrup 15 ml twice daily after food. 3) Any multivitamin which has B6, and B12 mainly. 4) Syrup Silymarin two teaspoons once daily before sleeping. This will help in improving your liver function. I hope this helps."

Congenital deafness and mutism has a genetic effect and may pass to future generation but incidences are very less as compared to other congenital and genetic diseases. You may marry with girls concern. Deafness and mutism in the next generation are due to so many factors. So deafness of father should not be criteria for rejection of daughter for marriage.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I am 33 years old. For the\u00a0past six months I am suffering from primary infertility, PCOS and diagnostic laparoscopy tubal block at right isthmus. Also, laboratory tests like Mantoux (positive), HBsAg (positive), ANA (positive) and LFT raised tests are done. The IUI done twice and my current medication is Metformin and Folic acid. Please suggest me. Doctor: Hello. Tubal blockage or fallopian tube obstruction is a major cause of female infertility. Blocked fallopian tubes will not let a sperm and ovum to unite thus interfering with fertilization. The primary and the very first step for pregnancy is the formation of zygote followed by embryo and its implantation. This step is interrupted in tubal blockage. I suggest you that if both the tubes are blocked, then there is no point in going for intrauterine insemination (IUI) and you need to go for IVF -in vitro fertilization. Before that I suggest you that you need to go for hormonal profile, D2 or D3 luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, prolactin, AMH (anti-mullerian hormones) and thyroid profile. After this IVF can be commenced like oocyte retrieval, spermicide collection, in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer are the steps. You need not worry about being HBsAg positive as a transfer to the baby can be prevented by giving Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination as per recommendation soon after the delivery. Your LFTs (liver function test) are raised and that is of concern as this may be a marker of acute viral hepatitis. I suggest you to go for HBeAg, HBV DNA and anti HBcAg-hepatitis B core antigen to know the viral replication. Being ANA (antinuclear antibody test) positive may lead to pregnancy difficulties like miscarriages due to immune rejection. This may need immunosuppressive therapy with steroids and progesterone supposition.

Also, my TSH and T3 levels are at the lower end of the normal range and my T4 level is below normal levels. After doing research, I found that low T4 with low or normal T3 and low to normal TSH can be indicative of secondary hypothyroidism relating to problems with the pituitary gland or hypothalamus.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

What is the average duration for Tagrisso to become resistant? Please clear my doubts. Doctor: Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. In reply to your question for Osimertinib (Tagrisso), Osimertinib demonstrated improvement in PFS (18.9 versus 10.2 months, HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.37-0.57) and duration of response (17.2 versus 8.5 months) relative to other TKI. The PFS (progression-free survival) benefit was consistent across subgroups, including either patient with or without brain metastases. Response rates for Osimertinib is around 80 %. To put it to simple terms, the disease is controlled for more than 1.5 years with Osimertinib. Treatment with an EGFR TKI is generally continued until there is disease progression. If there is persistent vomiting, we need to do more tests to confirm whether it is leptomeningeal (LM) disease which is diagnosed in approximately 5 percent of patients with metastatic cancer. The most common solid tumors giving rise to LM are breast cancer (12 to 35 percent), lung cancer (10 to 26 percent), melanoma (5 to 25 percent). Headache is the most common initial symptom of LM, present in 30 to 50 percent of patients with symptoms of confusion, forgetfulness, disorientation, subtle personality changes, and/or lethargy collectively referred to as encephalopathy or altered mental status, are common in patients with LM. I would request to do Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine which often provides important evidence of LM. The definitive diagnostic finding for LM is the cytologic identification of malignant cells within the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid)."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My wife is 35 years old and first time pregnant. She got pregnant naturally. She is running into 18 weeks and five days as of today. No history of any fertility treatment ever. Last week, she had bleeding with clots and tissues (one pad soaked each time) twice in four days interval. We consulted a local doctor and had a 4D ultrasound scan. The fetus is without anomaly but she has low-lying placenta covering the os and a 14x8 mm retroplacental clot was observed. She also has cervical polyp but the local doctor observed bleeding is not due to the polyp. Along with total bed rest, the local doctor prescribed the following:  Injection Proluton (once so far), Tablet Miprogen 200 mg twice a day for five days. Tablet Texakind 500 mg thrice a day for five days. Tablet Duvaldin retard twice a day. She has a tendency of sinus and recently had cough. Hence, the doctor prescribed antibiotics also.  Questions:  She is still bleeding, though lesser in quantity (maybe 20-30 drops). Is the above medication enough? Do you recommend any change?  Is this officially placenta previa situation?  We want to fly back home on the 25th having one and a half hours flight journey. Is this safe? I read contradictory views on cabin pressure factor. Are coughing and sneezing creating jerks contributing to bleeding? Since last USG mentioned \"covering the os\", does it mean there is a very slim chance of placenta moving away from cervix os in the coming weeks? Is this small but frequent bleeding fatal to the fetus? How to determine if it is time for blood transfusion?   Sorry for the long post. This is our first time and we are very anxious due to ongoing issues. Please guide us. Thanks. Doctor: Hello. Yes, the above medication will be effective and safe. The minimal bleeding will also settle down soon. Since it has been detected by scan, then definitely it is placenta previa.  At this point of time, it is better to avoid journey as it may increase the amount of bleeding. The placenta will definitely move up slowly as the pregnancy advances. Since the bleeding has reduced, it will not have any fatal effects on the baby. Regular timely scans will help to know when intervention is required and your gynecologist is the right person to decide. So relax and do not worry.

Doctor: Hello. I passed carefully through your concern and would explain that your symptoms do not seem to be related to cardiac ischemia. These muscle twitching may be caused by possibile water and electrolytes imbalances. This, in turn, is favored also by Adderall (Amphetamine) intake. I recommend checking your blood electrolytes level together with acid-base disorders. Trying some physical procedures, like warm massage over the affected area, in addition to any anti-inflammatory drug could be of value like Naproxen. Also, checking your ECG would be necessary for excluding any arrhythmic events or any feature that would indicate any hydro-electrolytic imbalances that may trigger the above symptoms. Sleeping not-well is an important contributor for generating muscle twitching and other issues. You should be careful with the drug intake and periodically check ECG and blood parameters to timely prevent further homeostatic abnormalities. You should discuss with your attending doctor on the above-mentioned issues."

Often it could get painful and very scratchy. Doctor: Hi. I have gone through your query. From the symptoms described, I feel that the itchy scrotum and the erectile dysfunction are most likely not related to each other. Firstly, about the erectile dysfunction, was it sudden in onset or did you notice a gradual decline in the erections? Do you have erections early in the mornings? Are you able to have a penetrative intercourse? Are you a diabetic or have any other medical illness? At 35 years, the erectile dysfunction is unlikely to be anything related to the blood flow to the penis. But a doppler study with erectile drugs will be able to confirm that. If the blood supply is normal you can be prescribed drugs to enhance erections, though I would also advise a psychological evaluation to rule out the stress-induced erectile dysfunction. Secondly, the itchy scrotum will require a clinical examination to see if there are any identifiable lesions. The most likely reason is a fungal infection which can sometimes be persistent or recurrent. Your local dermatologist will be able to take some skin scrapings and confirm that. The chance of STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) causing scrotal itching is less likely. Another possibility could be intestinal parasites which can sometimes cause itching in the perineal region. Again a clinical exam to check the region around your back passage and a stool examination will help."

He prescribed me a daily shampoo, R89 drops, B and T Zauberol Premium hair oil. For the past week, I am going with these medicines. However yesterday I noticed that one or two hairs here and there are regrowing in the area, but not all the hairs. I am also losing my hair on both sides of the front (forehead), in the last couple of years. Please suggest on both the matters and will it be possible to get back my hairs. Doctor: Hello. The side effects of the Eberclin M cream (Eberconazole+Mometasone) are skin thinning and dermatitis. Please do as I say. 1. Externally apply hibiscus flower oil to the scalp (or) rub the flower directly on the affected area daily, if possible. 2. Internally take homeopathic medicine, Graphites 30, two doses at bedtime, One today and second on the fourth day. One dose means ten pills. Just chew the medicine, no need to take water along with medication. Stop all other medication. Please inform me about your life next time. Are you under any stress or personal loss, etc? Alopecia areata. No combing on wet hair. Please inform me after seven days."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My fasting sugar is 180 and postprandial is 165. I am diabetic and take one tablet Janumet before breakfast and another after dinner. Why is this abnormal? Kindly suggest. Doctor: Hello. The blood sugar levels are still raised as your dosage must be insufficient. I would like to advise you to tell me the dosage of tablet Janumet that you are taking along with tablet Gluconorm. According to your fasting and postprandial blood sugar, I would then be able to adjust a proper medication and dosage for you. If you have any issues following up with me, you can meet your nearest physician or your family doctor, who can do it for you. Also, you should know that exercising and diet restrictions have an important role in maintaining your blood sugars and you should follow them religiously. There are two reasons to develop diabetes. One, because of pancreas not secreting enough insulin and two, our body tissues becoming non-responsive to the circulating insulin, because of a sedentary exercise less high-calorie diet that we follow for years together. That is why exercise is seen to improve insulin action in many patients and has helped us to keep the dosage to a bare minimum. Since you are overweight, I feel you should concentrate on losing weight by doing regular exercise and following a strict diabetic diet. It may help you to get off the medications or at least not let your present situation progress. Take care."

I sleep for about one to two hours at a time, then wake up and then again sleep. I do this the whole night. It makes me quite tired the next day. I have had multiple sleep studies done and there is no apnea or lack of oxygen. I have also tried tablet Ambien 12.5 mg and that gets me to three to four hours of sleep without waking up. But, I take that only on those days I know I can stay in bed for more than eight hours to make sure I am not groggy. It does not truly knock me out/make me sleep. I have also tried Melatonin and Benadryl which showed no effects. I have also tried Buspar to see if that helped. No real effect either. I am getting stumped as to why my sleep cycle has changed and why nothing is working. Please help. Doctor: Hi. Sleep problems are mainly due to either psychological issues or actual physical problems in the body. Before actually going to the causes of physical problems, I need to know if there are any psychological issue bothering you. Start taking capsule Omeprazole 20 mg every night half an hour before your dinner for two weeks and observe the response (this is an antacid medication and not a sleeping pill). You had mentioned about your shoulder surgery. Are you on any medications for that? Or any other pain medicines?  Also, you can ask your doctor for a prescription of tablet Zolpidem 10 mg every night which will give you a good sleep. But again, this is a temporary fix. We need to find the root cause to cure it. Kindly revert back with the details. Feel free to ask."

Doctor: Hello. The tonsil is at the entrance of your pharynx. So it traps most of the bacteria and viruses. So pharyngitis including tonsilitis could be due to streptococcus like bacteria or influenza like viral infection. The symptomatic management need to be done with decongestant tablet like Phenylephrine or Levocetirizine. Salt water gargle or dilute Betadine gargle is having great effect in relieving sore throat. Do not take excess spicy foods. Drink more water. If your tonsil remains enlarged then throat swab culture should be done to check for causative organism and treatment accordingly.

Please suggest me some creams, so that it should not show any side effects. Also, how long I should use it? If I use anything, then will it have any effect in case of pregnancy, etc? Please help me. Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/dermatologist"

I have lost two to five kilograms weight in one month. I changed my lifestyle. I had foamy poop thrice in these days. Is it because of antacids? How long is the course of Pan IT safe? Doctor: Hi. It is safe for a short-term period, for a month or two. But if necessary then the long-term is also continued as the side effects are not very serious. So I would suggest that you have it for a week. Then make it once a day and then take in a week or two. Most probably it is due to acidity and gastritis. Do you have upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, burping, increase in pain on food intake, sour water feeling in throat or chest burning? These are the other symptoms and may be associated. You should avoid fatty, oily and spicy diet. Have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Take lots of green leafy vegetables, and fruits. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. If not adequately relieved, then you should add Syrup Sucral O (Sucralfate with Oxetacaine) or Gelusil (Aluminum hydroxide, Magnesium hydroxide, and Simethicone) two teaspoons three times a day for a week.

I confirmed it when I was driving two days ago, and my Motrin 800 wore off and I could barely put weight in my seat. Pain radiated down to my leg and my butt on one side, and my tailbone felt displaced. I have been taking Motrin 800 which helps for the constant ache, but not with mobility. Doctor: Hello. Back pain following physical exertion or trauma may be due to injury to tendons, ligaments, muscles, disc, bones or vertebre, and local nerves.Any undue stress or twisting movement leads to muscle or ligament sprain leading to low backache, which is excruciating and is associated with restriction of movement. Here are a few signs that indicate significant cause that needs to be ruled out: Any bladder or bowel problems as difficulty in passing or sensing urine. Pain radiating to lower limbs. Tingling and numbness in the feet. Weakness in the lower limbs, difficulty in climbing stairs, or raising limbs due to weakness and not due to pain. If you have the above-mentioned symptoms consult a neurosurgeon, get the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) spine done for further management. I suggest wearing a back belt or a brace to support your back. Try heat therapy by placing hot bags over the area. I suggest taking skeletal muscle relaxants like tablet Flex P (Aceclofenac and Paracetamol) 15 mg once daily for relief for not more than one week to ten days. The best treatment for low back pain is bed rest."

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Is this fine for a starting plan? Doctor: Hi. Having polymyositis, you should start with a fewer resistance exercise and more of stretching exercises to improve flexibility. Yes, the exercise plan you made is fine for a good start. But maintain the muscle length through stretching exercises before initiation of the workout. Protein content increased by 250 gms per day and one gallon of water. Drink enough water before the workout. Take equal amount of rest in between the sessions.

The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

However, they have been continually elevated to the point that I was recently sent to a hematologist who initially thought I had CLL, but the flow cytometry test came back negative, then he did a T-cell gamma rearrangement test, also negative. At that point, he decided it must be autoimmune and sent me back to my PCP. Several years earlier when all this started, I woke up with joint pain, swelling and was sent to a Rheumatologist who decided I had RA despite every RA test being negative, and the joint swelling is not following what is clinically seen in RA (my joints were not bilaterally swollen, red, or hot. They were randomly swelling in my hands, feet and were really painful). So, I refused to take Methotrexate because I had no positive RA tests and after about a year, the swelling went down, the pain faded away and I have had no other flares since that time. So, my question is, should I try to get to the bottom of my chronically elevated absolute lymphocyte and if so, are there any other tests I should have my PCP pursue? I do not want to blame it on the RA when there is no proof I ever had RA but at this point, five years of elevated absolute lymphocytes are concerning to me and I feel like it is indicative of something, but I do not know what. Doctor: Hello. If you have any type of leukemia especially CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) or MBL (monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis) then it could have been reflected in the peripheral smear examination report or in flow cytometry investigation. Your flow cytometry report is negative and hence it suggestive of non-leukemia condition. Autoimmune disease chances can be there. So for that, you need to investigate with serum ANA estimation, ESR estimation and then if needed full autoimmune cell panel can be run to exclude any possibility of autoimmune disorder. If you have chronic cold symptoms then also it can be causative for high lymphocytes."

I get a slight amount of brown discharge occasionally. Should I panic about miscarriage? I am afraid because I had two miscarriages, one at 7 weeks and the other at 11 weeks last year. Please help. Doctor: Hi. At 6 weeks 4 days, you can have a scan, if it is still not done, to confirm the fetal heartbeat, as the baby's heartbeat only can confirm the health of the baby and to see the decidual reaction. Brown discharge only means that it is old blood and implantation bleeding. When the embryo bores into the decidual lining of the uterus, it causes few drops of blood to come out. This blood comes out of uterus a few days later as brown discharge. It is normal and nothing to worry. Do not worry about the history of miscarriages, the chances of repeated miscarriages are only 3 %, which means 97 % chances of healthy pregnancy. For your information, bed rest is not needed. No matter what history you had, the baby does not get attached to uterus mechanically, rather by chemical attachment. So, whatever you do, the baby will stay attached to the uterus. Pregnancy is not an illness, so enjoy every moment of pregnancy with good health and lots of prayers. Baby will do fine. Medicines are fine, Gestofit (Progesterone) makes the uterus relaxed and reduces the likelihood of bleeding from the decidual layer. The best method would be to insert the capsule Gestofit 200 mg or 300 mg vaginally twice a day, as the dose reaching the uterus will be the highest with no side effects of the hormone. Injection Fertigyn (Human chorionic gonadotropin) improves the decidual implantation of the embryo. If you already had a scan and health of pregnancy has been confirmed, I suggest you try Proluton depot (Hydroxyprogesterone caproate) 500 mg injection, intramuscularly once in every two weeks until 12 weeks of gestation. It will not allow any further bleeding from the uterus. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take medicine with their consent.

Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

What can I do? Is it possible to maintain the pregnancy by increasing the dosage of thyroid tablet and any ingestion taken for carrying the pregnancy? Please help. Is there any Ayurveda medicine for reducing TSH? Doctor: Hello doctor, I just read your query. See pregnancy is a very crucial phase of life. First of all, do not self-medicate. Increase or decrease of medicine should be left on your doctor. Pregnancy with hypothyroidism can be maintained accurately under the supervision of the doctor. At this point, do not try any other medicine or any home remedies. Just keep on taking your thyroid medication regularly according to your physician's advise because fluctuated level can affect the health of mother and baby. Go for regular check-ups to your gynecologist and enjoy this phase.  For more information consult an ayurveda specialist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/ayurveda-specialist"

It is common in elders and heart patients. There are two aspects of treatment, one is to control the heart, which is already controlled in ECG report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and another is to have blood thinners to avoid the risk of stroke. So, he has to be started on blood thinners like Dabigatran or Rivaroxaban to prevent stroke. This is an addition to other blood thinners like Aspirin. Also, his ECG printed report is showing a slow ventricular rate, so his drug should be modified to achieve a heart rate between 60 to 70 per minute. Otherwise, he may get dizziness if the heart rate is very low. So, discuss these issues with your local doctor. Overall, with medicines, this is not worrisome usually."

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

In autism, there are issues with social communication, verbal communication, repeated stereotypic behaviours which I do no\u2019t see in your description. What it looks like is that you have issues in managing your emotions and possibly relationships.

For 8 weeks, my occipital lymph node is hard maybe about 1 cm in size. It is in line with my left ear lobe and on the hairline. So not right behind my ear but more towards the back of my head. I have been having strange on and off headaches, shoulder aches or flu like symptoms but without fever. I can feel good for a week then I am just whacked out tired and low for a week. Physical activities just makes me feel weak and shaky. Last night I woke up in the night with random face, ear, neck itching but not all over. It would be pin point and changes position. Never had this in my life. I also have low testosterone and using Testogel for nine months. My last two blood controls showed all bloods to be normal with basophils at 1 % but the absolute basophils were 120 ul (normal range states 10 to 70 ul). The second control from one week ago showed same results. Bloods from one year ago showed normal absolute results and a lower basophilia percentage at 0.7 %. Sometimes, I am also having episodes where it is like an allergic reaction and I cannot breathe so good or my throat is closing. This is quite frightening and I get panic. Usually sleep helps this. So I am wondering if there is a link between the node and the absolute basophils. Do I need to get any further tests? Doctor: Hello. I have read your concern and below is my opinion for your case. The itching, headache, flu like symptoms and throat blockage are suggestive of some form of allergic inflammation of upper respiratory tract. The basophils count is also slightly high, so allergic inflammation seems most likely (attachment removed to protect patient identity). During that allergic episode you can be prescribed Levocetirizine plus Montelukast combination for five to seven days. The allergic inflammation can cause fatigue as well. If your fatigue is persistent than investigate further with calcium estimation, serum TSH estimation for further work up to exclude any low calcium and hypothyroid problem. For allergy, you can be investigated for allergy testing by allergy specialist doctor to find out causative allergen. The enlarged lymph node can be reactive enlargement of lymph node. But if it is persistently enlarged, then investigate further with FNAC for further work up to rule out nature of enlarged node. The node can be enlarged due to allergic inflammation as well. So it can be related to high Basophil. Your cholesterol value is also slightly high. So, you need to control fat intake in diet and do regular exercise. If you are obese, then lose weight by diet and exercise. Finally, let me tell you that anxiety and chronic depression also can cause weakness. So if any such history is present then let me know about that."

Now I left the exercise because I met with an accident. Now I have done my test again it was 18 again. Now I consulted the doctor but he said that I have to take medicines lifelong. It was really shocking for me and he prescribed me Thyrox 50 mg and Pure D3 60000 iu for four weeks and Rabeprazole 20 mg. But I am nervous and confused about taking this drug because I read somewhere that once you started taking this drug it will replace your thyroid hormones. Then you have to take the medicines life long. My weight is 80 kg, BP 110/180 mmHg, T3-0.98, T4-7.62 and TSH 15.98. Now kindly suggest me what should I do? Is it necessary to take the drug or is there any alternative? Please help. Doctor: Hello. First of all, you must have to understand the problem. You are suffering from medical condition called hypothyroidism. In this condition, the thyroid hormone production decreases. Thyroid hormone is necessary for the metabolism of the body and in the absence of this hormone body metabolic rate reduces and the person starts gaining weight. When thyroxine hormone decreases, TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) increases which trigger the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormone (T3, T4), and raised TSH level in the blood is a diagnostic factor, this is raised in your case. Management: We have to give thyroid hormone preparation in the form of thyroxine which comes under various brand names like Thyrox and this is necessary for body metabolism. Otherwise, you will have to suffer from some other medical problems, so it is advisable to continue this medicine as advised by your doctor until your TSH level become normal. Then you can again consult your treating doctor or us for further plans until then you must take it. Frankly speaking, there is no alternative to this. Here I noticed that your BP (blood pressure) is 110/180 mmHg. It is surprising that the diastolic is more than systolic. I think there is some typing error so again check your BP and tell, as this is suggestive of that you are hypertensive too, so you must start some anti-hypertensive medications. Rabeprazole is medicine for hyper-acidity. Advise: Weight reduction and salt restriction."

She lost her first pregnancy last year, because CHB was found on fetus by TIFFA at 19 weeks with fetal hydrops bradycardia. Now, she is\u00a08 weeks pregnant. Our obstetrician planned the treatment as Aspirin 75 mg once daily, Enoxaparin 20 mg daily, Progesterone\u00a0200 mg tablet once daily and Dailyfol. She also planned to start fluorinated steroids from 12th week and immunoglobulin from 16th week. When we went for a second opinion two days back, fetal medicine specialist found large subchorionic hemorrhage and advised just to stop Enoxaparin. She advised us to come back again after a month as it is a high risk pregnancy. Why did she say so? Later, we consulted our obstetrician and she also advised to stop Enoxaparin temporarily because it is necessary for controlling antibodies. She advised Duphaston 10 mg twice daily, Xamic 500 mg twice daily\u00a0in addition to the above and asked us to have a review after three days. We need a clear direction now. Can we prevent CHB with the above medication? Is really\u00a0there a need for Enoxaparin? Who is the right person to follow? Should she get steroids for prevention of CHB? She has morning sickness and back pain from the beginning of pregnancy. Doctor: Hi.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

      "tgt": "My sister's seizure is almost 80% under control. Is it still necessary to take high dose medicine?",
      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I would like to start by thanking you for the advice you may provide. This is regarding my sister, who is 16 years old. When she was younger, we noticed she would have these moments where she would just blank out. There were no body movements or other concerns, she would just zone out for a few seconds. When we told her PTP these concerns, he played it off as her just being a kid and zoning us out. But as time went on, we knew it was not that. We found her a new PTP and he did refer us out to a neurologist. Before four months, we were told that she had petit mal seizures. We did notice that when she had a seizure she would say huh and what. But, that was all that changed and she would sometimes just zone out and just repeat this even if nobody was talking to her.\u00a0The doctor wanted to start her with Ethosuximide 250 mg pill one in the morning and one at night. We noticed a great improvement. She still had the small seizures, but they were greatly cut down. But, she began to feel very tired, sleepy and would get headaches. On her next visit the doctor was not satisfied with the results. He said we would have to keep raising the amount of pills until she was 100% seizure free. But, I have read that some neurons are fine with an 80% improvement. Which is correct? I told him about her side effects, but he said it was normal. It would now be two pills in the morning and one at night.\u00a0This is where we came to see some trouble. Her headaches began to make her cry. She started to fall asleep in class and would get just want to be left alone. We called the doctor, but we just got the nurses who said they will leave a note for him and get back to us. He never calls and would talk to us during her next appointment. As we could not like seeing her suffering, my mom told her to just go back to her one pill in the morning and one at night. She is still sleepy, but was not crying over headaches. On her next visit the doctor was under the assumption that she had continued taking the three pills. His concern was if that had eliminated her seizures, which had not. Just like when she was taking two pills, in the beginning, the seizures were drastically cut back, but they were still there. He decided to put her in Lamotrigine 25 mg. He said to go back to two Ethosuximide pills and when she finished what she had left to start on Lamotrigine. Then, her finals week came along. She was sleeping less and was always studying. One day, with everything going on she forgot to take her medication. The next morning at around 9, she still had not had the chance to take her morning pill when she had her first ever tonic-clonic seizure. Can this happen from not taking medication for one day?\u00a0We took her to the ER. They ran some test and was told everything was fine and asked her to follow-up with her neurologist. I called the doctor and once again got the nurse. And was told while reading the notes, it seemed like he had wanted her to start her Lamotrigine pills while still finishing up on her Ethosuximide. They said they started her with 25 mg of Lamotrigine just to see if she did not develop a dangerous rash, but if not they would up her Lamotrigine dose. She had to take Ethosuximide until she ran out and would just continue taking Lamotrigine. She would be eliminating two 250 mg of Ethosuximide for one 25 mg of Lamotrigine. Will randomly cutting two Ethosuximide do her any harm?\u00a0When I told my sister this she refused to even touch Lamotrigine. She has pretty worked up from the ER scare and says she does not want to go back if she gets the dangerous rash. She is currently taking two Ethosuximide. I have noticed we are back to about one small seizure throughout the course of a day or two. Since the neurologist told us she had to be 100 perfect seizure free, my mom was thinking of following the neurologist's request to have her take three pills, since with two she is still getting some seizures. But, she was wondering if instead of two in the morning and one at night can she take one in the morning and two at night? This way, if she feels sleepy she is at home and not school and can go to sleep. My dad also read Omega 3 is good. But he got supplements at claim to have 2,000 mg. Is that too much? I know this is a lot of information, but I really need some sort of guidance. This situation is stressing our whole family. Once again thank you for everything. Doctor: Hi.

The doctors said that I do not need to be on them anymore. Is it possible that the pain is related to gastritis? Doctor: Hello. Acute gastritis pain usually subsides as the infection subsides. Is there any post-prandial fullness, early satiety, burning or pain? I hope there are no alarm symptoms like difficulty or pain during swallowing, weight loss, excessive vomiting, or any family history of upper GI (gastrointestinal) malignancy. At your age, the above symptoms are highly unlikely. At this stage, according to recommendations you can either continue Omeprazole 20 mg twice daily (or any other PPI) for four to six weeks or get yourself evaluated for H.Pylori antigen (by non-invasive means), or get an initial upper GI endoscopy done to rule out peptic ulcer disease. What I would suggest is to wait for some time and continue Omeprazole 20 mg twice daily (or any other PPI) for four to six weeks. If still continues you might need to get an H.Pylori screen test or upper GI endoscopy done. You can also try some lifestyle modifications like eating smaller, more frequent meals, avoid high fat and capsaicin containing diets. Eat less spicy food, stop smoking and alcohol if you do. Avoid Aspirin or other pain medicines. You can also limit your coffee intake as it may aggravate your symptoms. I hope this helps."

If the third layer (pulp) is involved and further the bugs percolate inside the length of the teeth, then the symptoms you feel would be there. Now the situation looks like you must visit a nearby dentist for either root canal treatment or extraction depending on your preference.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely.

I have no issue in lifting weights eg. bench press and there is no pain while doing any kind of lifts. Please guide me on my condition. Doctor: Hello. There is no link between masturbation and handgrip weakness. The cause of your hand grip weakness needs to evaluate further. You need an in-person neurologist consultation face to face because we need to examine your strength, reflexes, sensations of your hands. Is the weakness is more on the right or left? Do legs are involved or not? After a thorough physical examination only we can advise MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) cervical spine or nerve conduction study.

But that is not the truth. Exercise is essential to prevent obesity, heart disease, diabetes, etc. 3. Along with physical health, they should also take care of their mental health. Which means if they have any issue related to stress, anxiety or depression, etc. they should seek professional help. 4. Women should be aware of breast cancer, and if they feel any lump in breast or nodes around the chest, they should consult their gynecologist. 5. Women between 21 to 60 years of age should perform a test for HPV and pap smear test regularly after discussing it with their gynecologist. 6. Do not consume alcohol and avoid smoking as it affects fertility and also leads to other health issues. 7. After the age of 40, women should be careful about their bone health, but that does not mean take calcium supplements excessively because that may also lead to other problems. 8. Do not avoid health issues even if it is mild because it can lead to other problems in the future. Like high cholesterol level may lead to high blood pressure and heart problem in the future. 9. Always keep an eye on the menstrual cycle and if it is not regular, consult your gynecologist because a normal period is essential for female health. 10.

The image is not much clear (attachment removed to protect patient identity), but based on what I could appreciate, it looks like gingivitis. Hence, your gums look shiny and swollen. The reason could be deposits (though not much seen in the image), or puberty associated. Just do lukewarm salt water gargling as many times as possible. Use a soft bristles brush and follow bass sulcular brushing method. Brush once in 12 hours. Gargle after every meal. You can get scaling (professional cleaning of teeth) done by your dentist. Do not worry. It is a very common dental condition and can be cured. And, your gums are not receded, they are just swollen.  Do you have pain, bleeding of gums or tooth mobility?

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I got the influenza vaccination about a week ago and have a swollen and painful lump in my armpit. Doctor: Hi. I understand your concern. You are having lymph node swelling axillary post influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is a very safe vaccine. Although some may have local pain, swelling, and fever. Some may have local lymphadenopathy. Lymphadenopathy is a swelling of lymph node (normal gland present in our body, which function as clearing harmful substances and providing immunity). Local and systemic reactions mostly began between day 1 and day 2. When a lymph node rapidly increases in size, its capsule stretches and causes pain. Pain is usually the result of an inflammatory process. It is a reactive response of the lymph node to the vaccination. So no need to worry. It can be managed by simple Paracetamol or anti-inflammatory medication such as Serratiopeptidase. It should resolve within a week. If it is associated with fever or any other site enlargement of lymph node you can visit your physician. I hope this helps. Reactive lymphadenitis. CBC (complete blood count), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), USG (ultrasound) axillary lymph node. Lymphadenopathy. anti-inflammatory Paracetamol 500 mg twice or thrice daily or Aceclofenac, Paracetamol, and Serratiopeptidase combination tablet twice daily for three days. Follow up after three days."

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, How can a 50-year-old person reduce the pigmentation by using natural elements? Doctor: Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I assume you are referring to hyper-pigmentation, most often caused by UV rays exposure, and hormonal imbalances. Laser treatment can be very beneficial, but it is expensive. There are natural solutions, which can be quite effective. It is best to try a little bit on an area of skin that is not usually exposed to make sure that it does not cause too much irritation or an allergic reaction. Test it before you apply it to your face or other exposed areas that are pigmented. Here are some suggestions you can try, one at a time: 1. Apply a homemade face mask made with milk and honey, and leave it on the face for 30 minutes, then rinse off with warm water. 2. Lemon is amazing at lightening the skin. Dab it on the skin and leave on for 10 minutes, twice daily, then rinse. If you can find licorice root or a skin cream containing licorice, that is also beneficial to rub on with the lemon. 3. Raw potato is used often, grated and mixed with lemon, apply for 20 minutes twice daily for a month. 4. Mix apple cider vinegar and water in equal portions, apply for two minutes, then rinse.  5. Many skin creams use pure vitamin C for discoloration. Look at your store for a vitamin c serum, you could apply to your skin. 6. Rub vitamin E on your face at night. Natural supplements that you can take to decrease the pigmentation are: 1. Turmeric 500 mg three times a day with food. 2. Vitamin B complex, taken daily with food. You can eat strawberries, cherries and especially pomegranate fruits, which decrease the melanin production which causes pigmentation. Try to stay out of the sun. Wear hats, and sunglasses, and use a good sunscreen with at least 30 SPF (sun protection factor). I hope that helps."

An irregular heartbeat can be very much normal in healthy people and also sometimes abnormal. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are normal sometimes. On the other hand, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is abnormal rhythm, that has long term complications. These are the two most common reasons for an irregular heartbeat. If you again develop such heartbeats, then long term ECG monitoring (Holter monitoring for 48 hours or event monitor) may be done to diagnose abnormal rhythm. Sinus arrhythmia is almost never felt.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I had a very sedentary life during the last year, which is changing now. But my heart rate is still the same. Is this something to worry about? Doctor: Hi. It appears you are suffering from what is known as inappropriate sinus tachycardia. Of course, we have to see the ECG during palpitations to confirm that. I would also suggest a thyroid function test to rule out thyroid disease. It is good to exercise daily as that itself can regulate the rate. Also, continue Propranolol as having constant tachycardia can cause heart pumping to become weak.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I just want to confirm with you that fibromyalgia does not cause bulging discs. My workman's company blamed my fibromyalgia for disc bulging because in the past I have had headaches and neck pain with my fibro. The bulging disc pain was within three hours (numb, hurting, tingling arm all the way down) after helping a coworker shovel and then running a big vibrating roller. It was different than bursitis I have ever experienced. I developed a headache after the pain in my arm calmed down. The headache was in the front left of my forehead. Definitely not a tension fibro headache (I also have occipital neuralgia that came with the fibro in the back of my scalp). After hearing that it can happen while doing anything was when I came to the conclusion that that is the only thing I did differently that day. I feel like no matter what happens to me the fibromyalgia will get the blame. After researching degenerative disc disease, almost everyone has it. I do not think this is a well known fact. It happens as you age and can be as early as your teens and 20's. People also want to blame things on that as a pre-existing condition, yet if they had an MRI they would have it too. Otherwise, my spine is beautiful according to my doctor. I am 51 years old and was a heavy equipment operator and a PCA for my aunt at the same time while having three teenagers at home. The fibromyalgia and stress is really getting to me now though and I am having a tough time even working eight hours a week as a PCA. Just so tired and fed up with misconceptions and lack of doctor and public awareness. I hope this post and your answer will help other fibromyalgia patients because I know I am not the only one dealing with this. Doctor: Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. Fibromyalgia is still a less understood illness with pain and discomfort involving muscles and bones and the main feature includes that it is puzzling or difficult to identify. It is elusive and is a diagnosis. The diagnosis is made on the elimination of known conditions which might cause similar symptoms after using standard diagnostic tests and investigations. Therefore, if a patient is known to have bulging discs then it has to differ from fibromyalgia. In other words, you might have had fibromyalgia if there is no particular finding in the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. Therefore it is important to document MRI scan findings and then the diagnosis of fibromyalgia might be set aside and changed to include degenerative disc disease following the proof of bulging discs. The problem is that probably earlier investigations have led your employers to believe that you have fibromyalgia. However, a single incident has changed things for you and they refuse to accept it. The best way out will be to have evidence-based medical diagnosis and take suggested treatment. I agree that there is a lot of miscommunication about fibromyalgia and people with real problems are often labeled wrongly considering an earlier diagnosis which was made months to years back. In conclusion, fibromyalgia is not concerned with bulging discs and if your MRI scan shows bulging discs which might be related to your pain and discomfort symptoms then you have the option of making a point with the workman comp authority. Hope this answers your question."

The Kegel Exercise: Kegel Exercise\u00a0is meant to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles and treat premature ejaculation and impotency.\u00a0 You can do this exercise anywhere in sitting position either in a class room, office, or even in a public place and nobody will come to know that you are doing it.\u00a0 Before you start doing it, you must know the significance of this to the pelvic floor region. Around anus there are a group of muscles know as pubo-coccygeus muscles which control our urination and defecation process. We have to strengthen them by contracting and relaxing alternatively to achieve strong and intense erection of penis.\u00a0 The Procedure\u00a0:- By doing this, your pelvic floor muscles will become strong and will help you in attaining an intense erection for a longer duration.\u00a0You can strengthen these muscles and some other group of muscles also by doing this exercise, but in a different way: \u00a0 These two methods of contracting and relaxing pubo-coccygeus muscle will make them strong and will be helpful in improving your sex life.

My serum beta-hCG is <0.100 mIU/mL, total testosterone level is 4.14 ng/mL, TSH level is 4.02 uIU/mL, free T4 is 1.21 ng/dL, LH is 9.23 mIU/mL, prolactin level is 19.79 ng/mL, and estradiol (E2) is 32.43 pg/mL. I would like to know, are these hormone levels normal for an adult male? As suggested, I got my ultrasonogram done for my breasts and the reports are as follows. Nipple and subareolar tissue are normal. There is no retraction or skin thickening, no abnormal calcification and no axillary lymph nodes seen. The pectoralis and retromammary space appears normal. No focal or diffused lesions observed. Looking into my results, doctor told me that there are no abnormalities seen in both the breasts. In addition to all this, doctor asked me to try few exercise and check if there is any reduction in the size of the breast.

I can understand your concern and what you are going through from your report (attachment removed to protect patient identity), there is nothing to worry since it is not a major problem. Your condition is false gynecomastia. There is excess fat in your breast area and no extra breast tissue formation. Do not get depressed by thinking about it.

Though I remind myself that I am safe, my body cannot understand it. Why is it like this? It has been happening for years. Does that mean it will happen forever? Please help. Doctor: Hi. Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I can understand your situation and feelings. I can assure you that this is not going to be with you forever. You would benefit from counseling and therapeutic techniques such as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) by a clinical psychologist experienced in handling of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) following sexual trauma. I am sure you may have gone through some self-help resources and may have got in touch with support groups. If you did not, then please do so. Some groups can prove really helpful. A commonly followed helpful technique is to write down the whole traumatic experiences several times (and read them aloud to yourself in privacy, and of course destroy the papers immediately). This can be very painful in the first one or two instances, but soon the pain recedes and you will feel much much better with each rewriting episode. Do this until you no longer experience that intense stress. And every moment, keep in mind that its not your fault and its those who perpetrated that should be guilty. With counseling and therapy you will find positive changes sooner and would be able to improve the quality of life. My best wishes to you."

Your MRI report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) indicates neurofibromas in your dorsal spine, which is a benign growth originating from nerve sheath cells. Often it is symptomless, but at times can give discomfort to the patient due to mass effect and pressure in the surrounding structures.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary.

But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

In your foot, it is plantar fascitis. So for treatment, you have to do finger gripping exercises. For that, you can buy a smiley ball and do exercises 15 minutes twice a day. Along with that take tablet Cartigen Forte 1 tablet twice a day for three months.  For foot, get ultrasonic therapy done from any nearby physiotherapy center. Do plantar fascia stretching exercises.

His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you. Doctor: Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods? Doctor: Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have completed the fourth dosage for the day at 11.30 AM. His current temperature shows 102.7 F. Should I go ahead with Meftal-P 60 ml suspension if the high temp persists? If yes, then what time should I give him that and what would be the right dosage for him? Doctor: Hello. Most of the kids do not respond to Paracetamol alone which is present in P-250. I suggest giving syrup Ibugesic plus (Ibuprofen and Paracetamol) 12 ml which is required for his weight. And this should be repeated every six hours. If the child has a fever between those six hours, you can give Meftal P 8 ml. This can be repeated every eight hours. Always wait at least two hours after every medication for the fever to reduce. If it does not reduce, then you can give the second medicine. Also, always do tepid sponging of the whole body 30 minutes after giving medicine in case of high fever to dissipate heat faster. If the child develops any other symptoms like cold or cough give symptomatic medication for it. It looks like a viral fever as of now. Hope this has answered your question.

So you might have this hormonal pills effects for few weeks as these interfere normal menstrual cycle and prevent fertilization and pregnancy. Mostly after taking pills, there is withdrawal bleeding in 1 to 2 weeks and then there are some irregularities in periods for some time like unscheduled bleeding, spotting or delay in early periods. In this case, for your satisfaction, you can have serum beta hCG (blood pregnancy test) to know your status of pregnancy. But here as you said you took an emergency contraceptive pill (if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex), then less chance of pregnancy.

Flashes are usually due to retinal problems like retinal tears, or detachment. Floaters in diabetics can be due to blood in the vitreous. These have to be treated with lasers, retinal surgeries and/or intravitreal Avastin injections. As she is left with only 5% of vision these are the only options. Strict control of diabetes is a must.

Kindly help. Doctor: Hello. I do not see any problem in your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your blood reports and scan are within normal limits.Ultrasound scan is done at this 11 to 14 weeks to find out the most common genetic abnormality of the baby- Down syndrome. 1. Your age first diagnoses this, usually, as you cross 35 years the risk increases. For your age of 25 years, the risk is, very low. It has been mentioned in your report too. 2. The Nuchal translucency is the skin thickness of the baby's neck. In babies with Down syndrome, there is increased thickness. Up to around 3.5 mm is normal. Your level is normal. 3. Blood tests are the serum levels of PAPP-A and beta hCG. They are altered in the Down syndrome. As you see the risk of these above 1:250 is normal. As your values are above 4000, chances of any abnormality is next to impossible. Even the blood flow in the essential vessels are normal, which rules out Down syndrome (also called Trisomy 21). The only problem is nasal bone is not seen, and this could be ignored. If you want you can have repeat scan seven days later, by a doctor specialized in high-risk obstetrics.

When my husband tries to insert, I get so scared and never allowed him to penetrate. Even though we tried from different positions, it still does not work. He is very understanding. We only enjoy foreplay. Recently, I got to know I have septate hymen which can be 4 to 5 mm and I have heard with a septate hymen, intercourse is very painful and that makes me more scared. I want to enjoy sex and get pregnant as soon as possible. We both are very upset about this. Is there any medicine where there will be no pain during intercourse? Please help me. I am having a very bad time.We had visited a sexologist. After consultation and some tests, he has given medicine for both of us. For me, it is two medicines - one for reducing anxiety (Bupron SR 150) and another one for making mood (Etilaam MD 0.5) and for my husband to increase testosterone level (testostone supplement) and Tadgo 10 mg (before intercourse) but till now it is not working at all. We are following this for 10 days. Also, my husband has severe pain in the lower body till feet after using Tadgo. Now, he has suggested sex therapy, which we are not aware of that what exactly it is and how beneficial it is. Please let us know what should we do and suggest something which will solve our issues?Summarizing my questions as follows:Which medicine and gel which will reduce pain while intercourse?What medicine to take which will arise sex drive in both of us?How to increase testosterone level as my husband's erection is not lasting too long?Some overview of sex therapy.For my septate hymen, do I require any surgery? Doctor: Hello. I have gone through your problem and understand your concern. The drugs you are currently taking is quite helpful in some cases and not in few cases. From the description provided, it appears that because of one or other reason you never actually allowed your husband to do penetrations, it may be possible that either you have vaginismus or afraid excessively of sex that it may be very painful. In reality, sex is not painful. So, during sex therapy, the couple is helped by explaining the details of anatomy and how you can enjoy normal sex without too much worry and sometimes with help of some models or technique described by Masters and Johnson. Medicine or gel such as Lignocaine gel can be applied to the genitals, that reduces the pain sensation. Medicines other than what you are taking, like aphrodisiac or supplement such as Nanoleo total or Tetrafol plus, are helpful to some extent. Testosterone can be taken as a tablet or as an injection to increase its concentration by supplements. If the septate hymen is too thick and does not allow either finger or any other objects then surgery is advised. There are few instruments available in different sizes, they are used to dilate vagina by inserting them in the vagina, beginning from small size to larger size, in step by step. You can consider them as well. Feel free to ask if you have any questions. For more information consult a sexologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/sexologist"

It has taken some time to pinpoint, but it seems like these behavioral changes may correlate with when I began taking the medication. Prior to starting Levetiracetam, I had two grand mal seizures about 12-15 months apart. I frequently had what were diagnoses as epilepsy-related auras. Since I have been taking Levetiracetam, I have not had any more seizures or auras. I am happy the medication is working, but I am interested in advice about other possible medications or non-prescription treatments. Doctor: Hi. Your assumption is right, Levetiracetam causes behavioral disturbance as a side effect. There are two options now, 1. To taper off the Levetiracetam - if you have not experienced any seizure or aura in the last four years then we can go straight away with gradual tapering of the medicine, for that we need to know the last seizure/ aura episode, but with this, there is a risk of recurrence, you need to be cautious and under the watch of someone for few months. 2. Substitute Levetiracetam with Sodium valproate - in this risk of seizure is less, but still, it is there, on the fact the Sodium valproate is a mood stabilizer. Please do not do any of the above by self, you can consult a neurologist locally let him manage or get a telephonic consultation."

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

You will need and should get prescribed antibiotic like capsule Augmentin 625 mg thrice a day along with some antacid like tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg once a day before breakfast for five days. For symptomatic relief, antiallergic medicine like tablet Allegra 120 mg once a day preferably bedtime till this resolves. Also, for cough syrup like Alex 2 teaspoon SOS will be helpful. For a stuffy nose, you may use Xylometazoline nasal drops, a drop in each nostril SOS. Also, avoid using over-the-counter other than Paracetamol like Ibuprofen, Diclofenac.

My urinary problem has gone once I started taking antibiotic but I still do have back pain. I got my urine examination done today. I am attaching the report. Today I had slight vaginal bleeding when I wiped. Doctor: Hi. I have gone through your query. I would like to know a few more details. Is this the first time you have had a urinary tract infection or has it happened in the past? If so, is it frequent? Are you married, had any children? A single episode of UTI (urinary tract infection) in women is not a cause for concern. If you have repeated infections then it needs to be evaluated. Since you are symptomatically improving on antibiotics, I would suggest you to continue the same. If you still have symptoms after 72 hours of medication, then you would need further evaluation. Your urinalysis (attachment removed to protect patient identity) shows evidence of infection, but the specimen has been contaminated with vaginal secretions, so it is hard to say with certainty. I would ask you not to worry as in 90 percent cases uncomplicated UTI such as yours resolve with antibiotics in three to four days.

Doctor: Hello. I understand that the chickenpox scars have been disconcerting to you. The treatment approach would depend on the depth of the wounds. Very deep scars would need a procedure like dermabrasion. For superficial scars, you can try Tretin 0.025 (Tretionin) cream daily night. Apply it in small amounts and very lightly over the scars, daily night for two months. It will not lead to a 100 % reduction in the scars, but it would gradually make the scars less visible by tightening the skin. If you are not satisfied with the results after two months, consult a local dermatologist for dermabrasion."

I am signing up for sleepless nights so my main concern is antidepressants and the effect they might have while breastfeeding. Doctor: Hi. I have read your post thoroughly and I have to tell you that depression during pregnancy must be dealt with carefully. Pregnancy itself causes mood swings and there are episodes of depression, as a consequence of hormonal fluctuation. The best ways to deal with this during pregnancy vary from patient to patient depending on their level of depression. Provided your history with this and the suicidal attempts, you may need to be on antidepressants, which even though are generally considered unsafe for the fetus, a few are of pregnancy safety category C. Meaning, category C drugs may be given when benefits outweigh the risks in your case. Needless to say, these are prescription medications and I recommend you to see a psychiatrist who can evaluate your present situation and decide on that. Please note, that if you ever feel like you need medication during pregnancy, do not hesitate to consider the safer options because harboring something like depression can make it worse and cause more harm to the fetus than the drug itself. I hope this is helpful."

You are having a problem in deciding the power of glasses to be made. I can give you the following suggestions. Choose the power which is felt the best when you are undergoing testing. Choose the power which has the most precise vision, with no distortions, with no variations in the size of objects, and there is no eye strain. Most patients will get satisfied with this power. Choose the power which was given to you after verification using dilating eye drops. This test involves instilling dilating eye drops which blurs your vision. You are usually asked to come back to recheck on another day or sometimes prescribed glasses on the same day. This verification decreases the chances of error. An error of 0.25 diopter and an axis shift of less than 5 degrees is not noticeable in most circumstances. So if your glasses differ from each other by only small degrees, you can choose any one of them."

I cannot take this pain anymore. I have been experiencing it for as long as I can remember. I used to be insanely flexible but now I cannot arch my back without getting lightheaded. Last year, I consulted a doctor to find out what was wrong with me and the doctor did not believe my pain. Please tell me whats wrong with me. Doctor: Hello doctor, Sorry to hear that you have pain for such a long time. I am sure you understand that I cannot fully answer your queries without seeing you and examining you. But it sounds as though you have joint hypermobility with scoliosis. This can cause severe pain because your muscles have to work much harder than people without hypermobility to keep your joints in the correct position. So your muscles become tired much more quickly than other people. You have probably already researched hypermobility but a good source of information is the Arthritis Research UK website. The good news is that the condition is benign and does not lead to arthritis in later life. It sounds as though you need a comprehensive physiotherapy program with someone who understands hypermobility and scoliosis. You may also need an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan of your back to ensure there are no nerves being pressed on the back, and finally, perhaps you need to take some painkillers such as anti-inflammatories, Paracetamol or a neuromodulator such as Amitriptyline. You will always need to pace your activities more than other people to prevent excess muscle fatigue. I hope this helps."

It seems that the spine shows degeneration in the bones and disk but does not show any impingement of the spinal cord and the nerves. However, the cervical vertebrae are abnormally straightened as opposed to normal curve (this signifies muscle strain). The pain you are experiencing can be discoligamentous in nature, meaning this is coming from the disc and bones and joint attachments. It is a good thing that you do not have any motor weakness (signifies intact nerves). This usually resolves in pain medications and rehabilitative medicine in six weeks. This should help you.

For bone pain at two spots, investigate with serum 25 (OH-hydroxy) vitamin D estimation and serum-free ionized calcium estimation. You can provide that reports once done. Bursa or tendon inflammation also can be possible in your case. It happens if we overuse a particular portion of the body. You can be prescribed course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like Paracetamol and Serratiopeptidase combination."

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I had sex for the first time.\u00a0After that, I did not get my periods yet. I went to a gynecologist. She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods? Doctor: Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects.

I would like to know why has my endometrium lining decreased to this extent? Nine months back, I was pregnant but it led to a missed abortion due to rubella, so I got miscarriage in the 2nd month after which I had MTP and later also underwent D and C as the first attempt of MTP was not successful in removing the fetus. During this pregnancy my endometrium thickness was 8 to 9 mm. I also have PCOD because of which I had taken Ubiphene which helped me ovulate for that pregnancy. Now, it has been 5 to 6 months since the miscarriage and I was suggested Clofert 50 mg for inducing ovulation for 5 days. Since 2nd day of my last menses I am taking that and went for follicular study. On 8th day of my period the endometrium thickness was 1.8 mm and then again I went two days later and still endometrium thickness was 1.8 mm. I was advised to take Progynova once a day. Still my endometrium lining has not increased. Could you please tell me the natural ways to increase my endometrium thickness. I would really appreciate your guidance. Doctor: Hi. I have read and understood your problem. You have PCOS (Polycystic ovarian syndrome) so your ovaries might be producing less of estrogen and more of testosterone. Also you may have other hormone problems. You need to do blood tests Hb (hemoglobin), fasting sugar, prolactin, TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) and testosterone. Follicles of left ovary if 16.1 mm on 10th day is good. Progynova increase endometrial thickness. Soy food products will naturally increase estrogenic effects.

Also, I get pain even when I am standing, sitting, or driving and get pain in the morning after waking up. I live abroad and to get any medical attention requires months of waiting. I currently have an MRI booked in five months but my symptoms are getting worse day by day and I do not have the patience to wait until then. Is masturbation the reason for my problems? How can I fix these issues and get my life back to normal? Is MRI necessary? If not, what do I need instead? Please help. Doctor: Hello. Sorry about your health condition. Masturbation usually may not cause weakness or muscle problems. So do not worry, the possible causes for your problem is 1. Panic attacks or anxiety which lead to increased tension in muscles. 2. Hypocalcemia. 3. Fibromyalgia. 4. Hypothyroidism. 5. Vitamin D deficiency. 6. Rheumatoid arthritis. 7. Myositis. Still, many possibilities are there. So use vitamin E capsule like Evion 400 mg twice a day for two weeks. Use tablet Aceclofenac 100 + Thiocolchicoside 4 mg twice a day for five days. Avoid excessive masturbation as it may lead to penile mucosal injuries, lack of sex drive, etc. Eat more green leafy vegetables and fruits. Do yoga and meditation regularly to release your muscle tension. Get done hemoglobin level, thyroid profile, serum calcium, and vitamin D levels. Also, do RA (rheumatoid factor) factor, ANA (antinuclear antibody), ASO (antistreptolysin) are also useful.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy.

I tried taking OTC anti-histamines, nothing helped. Today I noticed a hard lump under the chin at right side right at the point where throat begins. What is causing it? Doctor: Hello. The symptoms listed by you point to chronic tonsillopharyngitis mostly secondary to the post nasal drip. Delving into the details, the constant post nasal drip is causing inflammation of the posterior pharyngeal wall and the tonsils in the throat. When these get infected the adjacent lymph node (the jugulodigastric node), palpable under the angle of the jaw where the throat begins, gets swollen. I checked the picture you have sent. It shows enlarged tonsils with granular congestion of posterior pharyngeal wall. We need to investigate you as to why there is chronic tonsillopharyngitis. We must evaluate the cause for post nasal drip. Most probably the post nasal drip could be due to some inflammation inside the sinuses. To rule out the same we must do a non-contrast CT scan of paranasal sinuses. At the same time, it will be prudent to get a monospot and streptoccal test done for the throat. Routine blood investigations will be helpful to check for agranulocytosis, infectious mononucleosis, lymphocytosis, anemia, etc. In the meantime, avoid spicy and cold food products. Desist from smoking and drinking. Drink plenty of fluids. I suggest you take a course of anti-inflammatory medicines, Chymotrypsin-Trypsin-Bromelain, taken twice daily in empty stomach for five days. I would also suggest taking Omeprazole 40 mg twice daily before meals for 10 days. In the meantime, you would get the tests done and get back to us with the reports. If the diagnosis is in the lines that I have thought, you would require treatment for the sinusitis which would remove the causative factor for chronic tonsillitis. In any case, the investigations will help us arrive at the most decisive diagnosis. Do revert back for further support and help."

Some chronic low-grade nausea that can disappear for weeks at a time and is not usually accompanied by a headache. I went through the gamut with GP, he then referred me to an ENT, and then to a neurologist. I am still getting some headaches but have had a clear CT scan of sinuses. A full neurological exam was done and that was normal, and the neurologist did not seem to think that additional imaging (MRI) was needed because my exam was normal. Even though it was a CT scan of the sinuses, they would have seen the brain (particularly frontal lobe) and notified of any abnormalities they could see. I had a clear MRI approximately one year ago for some twitching and muscle pain. Do you agree that further examination is not warranted? In other words, with the above information is a structural problem unlikely? Doctor: Hello. You have been elaborate in providing your medical history and that always helps to form an opinion. Coming to your straightforward query, I really do not see any indication for a fresh brain imaging study like CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in view of your transient, very short lasting symptoms and a normal MRI brain, just one year back. Instead, I would suggest here to get one electroencephalogram (EEG) done to look for abnormal electrical discharges in the brain during those episodes. EEG done during the time frame when you are frequently having those episodes will be more rewarding in terms of diagnostic importance. With a normal neurological examination and normal MRI, you should stay calm and assured that it is nothing serious. Lastly and importantly, anxiety is the commonest cause of such symptoms. Please start doing mental relaxation exercises, meditation, yoga and observe for improvement. I hope this helps."

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods? Doctor: Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you. Doctor: Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

No, you can never get pregnant with oral intercourse only. Vaginal intercourse without precaution would lead to pregnancy during the fertile period. And the periods you are having is not because of pregnancy but may be because of hormonal imbalance. Get your thyroid profile and serum prolactin and fasting insulin FBS.

During that time I had been taking Valerian root to help me sleep, except recently, it seems its potency has worn off, or my body has become used to its effects. A doctor prescribed me Zimovane (Zopiclone) for sleep but did not ask about prescriptions I am currently taking. Does Zopiclone have any effects on birth control prescriptions? Particularly Rigevidon? Doctor: Hello. Zopiclone is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic agent, helps in maintaining sleep, long acting, reduces the number of awakenings, improves the quality of sleep and has minimal abuse potential. The usual dose is 7.5 mg 15-20 minutes before sleeping, and should not be used for more than four weeks. As such Zopiclone has no metabolic interaction with birth control pills, so you can continue to have them even on Zopiclone. However, if you want to conceive, then you should not take Zopiclone, as it can lead to withdrawal symptoms in neonates. Hence if on birth control pills, you can continue to have Zopiclone for about four weeks, after which you should seek an opinion from a concerned psychiatrist. Burnout. Insomnia (primary). Zopiclone 7.5 mg. Sleep hygiene. Avoid stimulants at late night. Follow up after two weeks. Take oral medications continuously."

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours.

For the last fifteen days, he is feeling restless all day long. He gets relief when he sleeps. So all the day he sleeps or just layover. He is depressed and does not talk much. He is also diabetic and having high blood pressure but both are under control. His current medication are as follows: Lamex OD 50 one tablet at night. Rexipra 10 one tablet day and night. Zona 0.25 two tablets three times a day. Dimax OD 250 one tablet at night. Along with regular medicines of diabetes and hypertension. These medicines are on for last 15 days, but he is not getting relief from restlessness. Please advise. Doctor: Hello. The first thing I like to tell you that as per my knowledge there is no Dimax 250 mg and Lamex 50 mg. I am assuming that Dimax in query stands for Diamox (Acetazolamide) 250 mg and Lamex 50 mg stands for Lamex (Levofloxacin) 500 mg. The problem you described is very much inadequate to make any conclusion, but I will try my best to map out the problem for your father. Feeling restless, feeling depressed and not talking much are indicative of depression. It can be labeled as a bipolar disorder if he has an episode of irritable or elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, over talkativeness, pressure of speech and expansive behavior in the past lasting for at least four days in a single stretch. If he had features of both these things described above at the same time then there is also a possibility of bipolar disorder. I would like to inform you that a pure psychological kind of bipolar disorder is very rare after the age of 50. If his first problem started after 50 years of age then the possibility of organic bipolar disorder is very high when compared to psychological bipolar disorder. The other possibility in his case is delirium. This is a kind of confusional state in which patient has difficulty identifying family members, name and detail of place where they are placed along with disorientation to time leading to the reversal of sleep-wake cycle (sleep in day and remain awake in the night). Many patients with delirium also reports the presence of objects that are not visible to others. The cause of delirium in your father may be preexisting diabetes and hypertension, medication, overt infection or electrolyte disturbance. The third possibility is of stroke as he is having multiple risk factors including age, hypertension and diabetes. At this stage, I have a few suggestions for you. 1. Stop the Zona from today itself. 2. Get his electrolyte done including serum sodium, chloride, magnesium and potassium. If any abnormality found report back with details. 3. If CT scan or MRI not done till date this is high time to get it done. If already done please send the report along with the next query. 4, Do the blood sugar monitoring every four hours. At this moment he needs detailed evaluation along with proper history. For the same, you need to present the other data so a firm conclusion can be made and future management of patient can be decided."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

The nodules found six years back would have manifested into multiple lesions by now if there were cancer and you are right in your thoughts.

When I was consuming this, I got heavy pain in my body and after some days I found that fat under my thighs, palms, hands, legs, chest, feet and soles has been lost (it is still continuing). A swollen lymph node in neck appeared and my left parotid gland became swollen. I consulted an ENT. He prescribed Moxclav 625. The swelling in the parotid gland subsided and again after some days there was swelling and the doctor gave me Piroxicam. Again it subsided and then after some days again the same problem raised and the doctor gave me Claribid 500 for five days and it subsided. A scan was done on my neck and the result showed: Enlarged left parotid gland with diffuse decrease in echogenicity possibly parotitis. Cervical lymphadenitis: Enlarged lymph nodes noted in the left posterior cervical, submandibular and upper jugular group. They show maintained fatty hilum and ovoid shape.

I need to know some more information such as how much weight have you lost in the last four to six months, the presence of any other symptoms like fever, diarrhea, joints pain, recurrent oral or genital ulcer. Was there any ulcer over the scrotum during the swelling? The symptoms which you have are very non-specific and can be associated with any chronic illness. So further tests will be guided by your symptoms. Are you in touch with the lady, if yes does she have any particular illness? Firstly, there is very less likelihood of HIV, almost nil. At this stage, the possibilities I would keep are of syphilis. However, your VDRL is negative. Orit may just be a psychological issue due to overthinking about that exposure. Anyway, you will need some more investigations like complete hemogram with ESR and CRP, liver and renal function test, ANA antibody test, chest X-ray. For syphilis, you will need other tests like FTA-ABS or TPPA or MHA TP. If none of the above are informative, we may need a CT scan of the neck, chest, and abdomen.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I have a question here. I had a toenail injury last month (cause: fell down, toe landing first onto the floor, which made the nail get loosened). I did go to the hospital to get it treated. The doctor cut off half of my nail, cleaned and dressed it, and kept re-visiting to get the dressing changed. The doctor said that I could stop re-visiting. And then she told me that the nail would have to be removed again after it grows back fully. But, I am hesitant and kind of rejecting to do so. After a month, the nail is not loose anymore, but the nail seems to be growing outwards, and between the nail and the nail bed, there is a gap (kind of like a hollow gap inside). Should I just wait until the nail fully grows back? Should I cut it? What should I do? I am really worried that it will not grow and it will completely fall off once I start wearing shoes. Please note: I am going on a horse riding and hiking camp the next month. Just in case if it does not grow back by then, what should I do or wear to protect it? Doctor: Hi. I understand your worry. I think you need to follow your doctor's advice (get the nail removed surgically), as it seems that the nail is detached from its bed. But get the procedure done only by a surgeon or a dermatologist. And get it done as soon as possible, because the earlier you get it done, the more the chances are that your nail will grow back before next month. If the nail has not grown back completely before then, do a good sterile dressing during camping. Hope this helps. Take care."

There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it?

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

When was your last sexual contact, and after how many days did you get yourself tested? Is the burning sensation during peeing, throughout urination or just stay the start? Do you have to strain to pass urine or have frequent urination? Is there any pain around the lump you noticed and is it painful to touch? Do you clip your scrotal hair or shave them? Looking at the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity), the redness surrounding the lump, it appears to be some inflammation of the hair follicle involving only the skin. It usually subsides with mild antibiotics, and as you are already on them, you do not have to do anything additional. I would, however, urge you to visit your local dermatologist or urologist for a visit, as a clinical exam is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.  Regarding your burning sensation during urination, I would suggest you wait till you finish your antibiotics and if it persists, a urine examination would help to identify if there is any urinary tract infection."

In your case, the fracture line is entering into the cuboid-metatarsal joint. Hence, some pain may be present. I would like to have a look at the lateral view x-rays of your foot as well your knee to check for any injury associated with other tarsometatarsal joints. Pseudo-Jones fracture. 1.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, My son is 2.5 years old. For a week, he is complaining of stomach pain. After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you. Doctor: Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience. Child will eat properly now as he has recovered from illness."

So the doctor prescribed DV 60K once a week for two months and then once in a month. I am having this medicine for three months. I was fine and had no pain. Now already I took 15 pills in a period of three months. Now I am having pain all over the body. Hand pain, joint pain, and lower leg pain, even I took rest but it is still there.  I did blood work. Everything looks fine and within normal range except high cholesterol. My calcium level is good 10.1 mg/dl. I feel tired and fatigued all the time. I got watery stools for the past three months, I know this is not diarrhea. My stool is clear and no WBC in it. My urine is clear. I got a gland on the floor of teeth and a small lymph node in the neck. I completed an antibiotic course for it, but they are not going to its original size. My question is why am I having pain all the over the body even when I am having a high dose of vitamin D (DV 60K)? My calcium level is good but why I feel bone pain? Why I am having watery stools? I am vitamin D deficient so do I have cancer? Doctor: Hi. See muscle pain or joint pains, watery motions are some of the side effects of vitamin D. These symptoms can also be seen in thyroid problems or diabetes. You have mentioned that your blood reports are fine, but have you been tested for thyroid and diabetes? No, definitely it is not cancer so relax. My advice to you is to take vitamin D once in two months instead of monthly once. Get exposed to bright sunlight. Repeat vitamin D test after two months."

For now I would suggest you to get a full mouth scaling and root planning done if possible in your area, after that follow these: Drink plenty of water. Avoid things like raw garlic, onion. Take more fresh fruits and vegetables. Chew parsley, it helps. Clean your tongue after you are done with tooth brushing. Floss at least once daily. Rinse off properly after every meal and clean your teeth with fingers. Do warm water and salt rinse three to four times daily. Do not take in more of sugary things as they stay for longer time in your oral cavity and cause bad breath. Keep clove in your mouth. I hope this helps."

I went to the hospital and the doctor said any infant who has fever without any other symptoms may have meningitis and so lumbar puncture was performed. It was positive and the WBC was 570 (clear), monomorph 80% and polymorph 20%. Though the culture of CSF was negative, no bacteria found. He was put on Penicillin and Cefotaxime for two days, but the fever did not settle down. Then, Penicillin was replaced with Vancomycin and the fever finally went away. He was on Cefotaxime and Vancomycin for 14 days. Then, CBC and differential had been tested and the neutrophils were low. It read 0.6. The next day before my baby was discharged it read 0.7. The doctor said that as long as it kept raising there was nothing to worry about. A week later the same test was done and the neutrophils were 0.9. Two weeks later it read 0.6 and then 0.9 and 0.6 in an interval of every two weeks. It kept raising and decreasing, but overall it is still very low. I have not noticed any viral infection other than sometimes he gets red eyelid and teary eyes, but it disappears within a few hours. He usually rubs his face, eyes, nose and ears, especially when he wants to sleep. When he was in the hospital, I found a soft lump on his head.

I\u00a0visited a pediatrician today who encouraged me to meet a hematologist.\u00a0What is the reason behind neutropenia? Also, he has high lymphocytes of 7.70, lymphocytosis.

Based on your query and attached reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), my opinion is as follows: Routine evaluation is not necessary.

The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Please share your knowledge and also if there is a chance of spreading STD/STI /HIV/AIDS in this situation. Doctor: Hi. Outside of the body, sperm may die quickly when they are exposed to the air. The length of time they stay alive has a lot to do with environmental factors and how fast they dry up. So it is very unlikely for her to get pregnant if she touches your pants and do masturbation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

There could be various differentials for tubo-ovarian mass-like lesions of infectious origin, such as a hydrosalpinx or tubo-ovarian abscess caused by pelvic inflammatory disease, physiologic or functional cysts, and endometriomas. The next best would be a per vaginal examination to rule out PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) first and then a course of antibiotics and if still, the TO-mass persists then diagnostic laparoscopy and removal of the mass and then sent for histopathology to establish the diagnosis."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

My fasting blood sugar level is 140 mg/dL and on taking Gemer-1 my postprandial blood sugar is 72 mg/dL. Why this happens? Doctor: Hello. Yes, it happens. In a diabetic, fasting blood sugar usually results from a combination of factors, the two most important being, 1) What you ate the day (or night) before and how high your blood sugar spiked. If you have very high blood sugar the night before, you should expect your fasting blood sugar to be elevated. Sometimes an eight-hour fast is just not long enough to bring down the blood sugar. 2) Dawn Phenomenon is common in diabetics, and it is when hormones that you produce in the morning cause your liver to release more glucose for energy. Either way, higher fasting levels result. Often Dawn phenomenon and high blood sugar from the day or night before work with each other. When you eat, the liver stops pumping out so much glucose, and postprandial blood sugar can drop, which is what happened to you. My suggestion is to do a pre-dinner sugar and see what is your blood glucose level before dinner. If it is high (>130), we have to alter the drugs and dosage. I hope this helps."

Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling.

Like sitting at a desk all day. Doctor: Hi. Loss of flexibility and degeneration band ageing go hand in hand. Growth spurts loss of flexibility is due to mismatch in the rate of bone and muscle length growth. Peak fitness is in late teens and early third decades. Ability to squat, touch the tips of fingers on the floor, able to hold hands behind the shoulders, etc., indicate normal flexibility. Yoga, swimming, pilates, etc., are some means of maintaining flexibility. Improved flexibility leads to lower wear and tear of the joints and overall the muscle strength is maintained as the joints are not painful to move. Lack of flexibility comes from the sitting and not taking the joints through the range of movement and in general not being active as well as doing the chores daily."

As you mentioned that you are suffering from depression and was always undermedicated, in depression, it is common to have a disturbance of memory and attention which lead to forgetfulness.

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I would know the friends I have, but I was not able to remember what was happening to me right now, if I am mad at anybody right now, do I have some guy that I am talking to, etc. When I would check my messages I would see approximately what was going on in my life, but I would still not remember when was the last time I saw some of my friends do I have some special birthday gifts planned for them, do we have a special joke for something at a time. I would just remember they are my friends and maybe like 30% of our time together. It was the same about school and I could not remember what we were doing and what I already studied so I had to do it from the beginning again. The situation got worse when I went to college, and now it is even worse for me because it happens that I wake up and everything that is happening to me feels so distant like it was a few months ago, and not yesterday. Previously, it would usually only happen every couple of months over the night, but for the last three nights, it keeps repeating. I would like to say that I have no problems with drugs, marijuana, etc. I have never used. All of this I already told to my doctor but she did not take me seriously enough. They did take photos of my brain and I do not have injuries. I would also just like to mention that I have very low sugar so do not know if it could be related to my memory, my doctor advised me nothing about that, she only said that she does not know how I am alive with such low sugar, but that it did not matter because I am young. Please help. Doctor: Hi. First of all, a good memory needs a balanced diet, which contains all essential vitamins and minerals such as vitamin B complex, carbohydrates, proteins, and a small amount of fat. Moreover, some drugs like oral contraceptive pills can lead to decrease in vitamin B complex in your body. Stress, pollution, and junk food have a negative impact on memory. The brain needs glucose to work properly, but too much glucose can disturb the memory and the whole brain function. Vitamin B complex deficiency. Patient may have memory problems related to lifestyle. The patient should take vitamin B complex once per day after meals and Benfotiamine 40 mg twice per day after meals. The patient should eat healthy food and avoid too much fat, sugar, and salt in her diet."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, My son is 2.5 years old. For a week, he is complaining of stomach pain. After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you. Doctor: Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience. Child will eat properly now as he has recovered from illness."

Apply ice for 10 days. Physical therapy should be continued but in the observation. Take ultrasound therapy over heel with an analgesic gel for 10 days. Ask your doctor to provide manual therapy for ankle joint for mobilization and strengthening exercises to improve the strength of muscles surrounding the ankle joint which gives more stability, and gradually the pain decreases.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

About 14 months ago, I got one of these on one side of my leg and middle of the upper thigh. It got worse over a few days and then blew up very infected, and I went to the hospital and had to have four IV antibiotic drips. I was there about 36 hours at the hospital. The entire upper leg was swollen down to my knee. The diagnosis was cellulitis. Through last year I had several more of there sores, always on the left side of my body only which I thought was strange and interesting as to the cause? Several on the left side of the torso from a few on the side of belly and about ten at different times upside of my chest or near left armpit. I have had several lumps under my left armpit (about eight or so, some two or three at once) which can get quite painful. These have all cleared up by themselves over about two to three weeks but were red and some with red radiating outward on my skin, but I was able to fight off the infection. I have also had a rash under my left armpit several times. I had a more severe one near my left elbow about three months ago that the infection was spreading up my arm. So, I got oral antibiotics from the doctor and it cleared in about four days. I have just now in the last few weeks had another near my left elbow (still there and very sore) and a second one appeared nearby about five days ago. Initially, the first one looked like red was spreading but I put some antibiotic eye cream on the area each day for past week and it has gone down a little but both are still very sore. Overall, I am really wanting to find the cause and fix this. I had not taken antibiotics for about 15 years before the first leg episode about 14 months ago. I have changed my diet a lot to be eating very healthy past 12 months. So, I am surprised with this unless its something relating to gradual detox. I am not eating many complex carbohydrates (rice, bread, pasta) and stick mainly to lots of green vegetables and good protein like grass fed meat, free range chicken, salmon, and free-range eggs. I guess sometimes I may go in and out of ketosis a bit. When I drink, I drink a fair bit (15 standard drinks) but only do this once a week. Unsure if this is related. Hoping to get to the bottom of this. Thanks. Doctor: Hi. It seems like a frequent case of bacterial infection of your skin. Why are you frequently getting bacterial furunculosis is what we need to look at. This usually indicates an immunocompromised state or underlying uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or a complement deficiency disorder. What I can gather from your symptoms is that you get bad cases of furunculosis, some with infected axillary lymphadenopathy (the tender lumps in axilla). The axillary rash is something else which also occurs in diabetics or immunocompromised individuals. It is called erythrasma. It also occurs with obesity as in your case. It would be helpful to know a bit more about your condition like, Given your BMI, you are very prone to insulin resistance. Hence we need to take a look at your blood glucose levels. I am very hopeful we can get to the bottom of this. We need to look at it in a stepwise manner, ruling out possibilities and establishing a diagnosis. Please give me the details I asked for and get the following investigations done. Investigation to be done: If these turn out to be normal, then we have to check your complete immunoglobulin levels.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks.

Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

People spending longer time on computer, laptop screens have greater chances of developing dry eyes. Because while using computer, blink rate is decreased to 1 to 2 time per minute. Normal blinking is necessary to keep eye surface wet and eyelids function as wipers and spread tear film on corneal surface. If you do not blink, eye surface gets dry and you will feel irritation of grittiness or mild redness. Longer time you spend on screen, more chances of developing dry eyes.  So you need to slightly modify blinking habbits while working on laptop, screen. You should blink every 15 to 20 seconds to keep eyes wet. Secondly, you can use artifical tears, lubricants to minimize dryness. You can use Systane eye drop or Tears Naturale eye drop or any other tears available to you. You can use 3 to 4 times but you can also use more frequently if you feel so. There is no side effect of these drops, these are only artificial tears. I hope your problem will be solved."

I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your ECG is normal. In the echo, there is AML (anterior mitral leaflet) prolapse, which means there is slight backward bulging of the valve leaflet. This is mild and there is no leakage in the valve. The risk associated with this is of valve leakage called as mitral regurgitation and it is not there. In most of the individuals, it is benign and does not lead to any complications and some may develop leakages. In you, it less likely to develop leakage as it is not there at present.

Leg swelling slowly reduced and the platelet count reached 125000. Four months before, she had a leg swelling and it got cured after taking some medicines prescribed by a doctor. Basic creatinine, dengue, blood test, and scan were done. Light swelling in the liver and spleen is seen. Dengue and other basic reports showed negative. Today we received a report positive (ANA), Pattern: Nuclear fine granular (strongly positive). This may be associated with SJS, SLE, neonatal LE, Polymyositis, dermatomyositis, progressive systemic sclerosis. Can you please advise. Doctor: Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I have gone through your question and understood your concerns. Autoimmune attacks that lead to decreased platelet count (thrombocytopenia) are mostly associated with systemic lupus syndrome or can be associated with rheumatoid arthritis in case there is an associated joint involvement. I would recommend that you get an anti-lupus antibody testing and rheumatoid factor testing to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.  I hope this helps."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am seriously facing acne pimples problem. Sometimes they occur on my face when I masturbate. If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result. Is it okay to continue this? Doctor: Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Your gynecologist may help you with that. They may also cause a delay in the regular next periods or cause an early next period or spotting.

I was suffering from mild constipation (first poop is easy but clearing remaining used to take some time from past few months. I used to spend at least 15-20 minutes in loo. This is when I observed urine retention and mild constipation). From past few months, even my rectum was paining. History of UTI: It all started with severe pain after the passage of urine five months back. It was diagnosed as seminal vesiculitis and urologist said that it is common among men and advised sitz bath whenever it pains and advised me to have sex regularly. Though sitting in hot water tub helped me and it relieved me from pain, but the pain was recurring every 20 to 30 days. This continued for almost 18 months. Four months back, I had few drinks (I never consumed alcohol earlier) continuously for a few days, and that triggered severe pain after urination. One day it was so severe that I noticed blood in urine (hematuria) and urination was very frequent on that day. I suffered from fever also that day. The very next day I went to a urologist and got it diagnosed.

With your elaborate history what I could make out is that you had a severe episode of acute prostatitis which was undertreated and now it is chronic prostatitis syndrome. Also, you have severe constipation. Sildoo is silodosin which is a highly potent alpha-blocker. I would like to place you on an alpha-blocker like Alfuzosin which will not produce any retrograde ejaculation in young males. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take medications with their consent. Also, you have to correct your constipation. Could you send a picture of uroflowmetry with the date? I would like to do a fresh uroflowmetry with post void residue for you. Prostatic symptoms at times are not related to its size rather to the alpha receptor overactivity.

She is taking calcium and vitamin D for her osteoporosis and I have given her some vitamin K2 and D3 drops as well from time to time. She is 85 years old. Doctor: Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I can understand your concern. According to your statement your grandmother have been suffering from purple spots on leg and arm with osteoporosis. When small blood vessels are ruptured causing blood to pool under the skin and can create purple spots on the skin are known as purpura. Purpura may be resulted from illnesses such as bleeding disorder, recent history of blood transfusion, cancer, SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), infections like HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), hepatitis C, CMV (cytomegalovirus), EBV (Epstein Barr virus), etc. It may also occur due to inflammation of blood vessels, blood stream infection, vitamin C deficiencies, medications like Heparin, Aspirin, Sulphonamide, steroid, chemotherapy, Digoxin, Hormone replacement therapy, etc. Purpura are usually benign and may resulted from above mentioned causes and it sizes can vary from small dots to large patches. Senile purpura is benign which affects older people as their skin and underlying blood vessels become more fragile with aging and may bleed from minor trauma. The treatment depends on causes and most of the purpura does not need any treatment and dissolved over time. It may take 4 to 6 weeks to heal. The treatment are only needed for those which are not disappeared over time. You can use topical retinoids along with her current medications. I want to add that according to the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity) that are shown here, your grandmother have been suffering from age-related senile purpura. Give her vitamin C and citrus foods like orange, lemon, etc., with application of sunscreen and sun-protective clothing along with previously mentioned medications."

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I can eat normally, but some times I feel bloated and cannot eat. I keep burping like once in 20 minutes. Is that normal? And also bloating increases when I have anxiety. I am taking Sompraz L (Esomeprazole 40 mg and Levosulpiride 75 mg) once in an empty stomach daily. Whenever I try to leave the medicine I have gas and acidity on the second day. I also take alcohol like 90 ml regularly for three years. There is no pain or anything but only burping and bloating. I wonder is it just anxiety or something serious? I am also very much afraid to visit a doctor least they prescribe endoscopy. I am 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 78 kg. I had an ultrasound about one and a half years ago and it was normal. Please suggest. Doctor: Hello. Well, the burping while having meals, or just after the meals is a normal phenomenon. And I assure you it is not alarming in your case. However, it may cause trouble if gas trapped excessively and result in belly swelling. The reason behind this excessive bloating in your case may be aerophagia (engulfing air while taking meals that commonly occur in one who keeps speaking while having bolus) can be due to supragastric belching and may be due to excessive gas production after meals. The last group of people in medical science are termed as bloater, some are early bloaters where bloating occurs within 15 minutes of meal and some are late bloaters where bloating occurs after two hours of meal. This whole explanation is just to make you understand your own condition well. You seem to be late bloater and cause seems to be excessive gas production plus aerophagia. I want you to take a three-week course of antibiotics to reduce the excessive gas production within your bowel. The antibiotic is safe without any side effects except in some may cause diarrhea of mild intensity. SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth). Tablet Rifxamin 200 mg thrice daily for three weeks and then stop, tablet Digestine (Metaclopramide) 40 mg half an hour before meals for one week and then as per need. You can stop Sompraz L, as Tab Digestine will work in more effective way than this."

This looks like chronic prostatitis (long standing inflammation of the prostate). It can be confirmed by a rectal exam, sometimes enlarged prostate on sonography and in some cases positive urine or semen cultures. In some cases, diagnosis is clinical as all tests are negative. Treatment includes long term antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, and medicines to soothe irritated nerves. I would suggest a semen culture, a post-prostatic-massage urine culture and sonography of prostate. Start tablet Moxiflox (Moxifloxacin) 400 mg once daily for 10 days, Enzoflam (Paracetamol, Diclofenac, and Serratiopeptidase) twice daily for seven days, Pantocid (Pantoprazole) 40 mg once daily for seven days, and Tryptomer (Amitriptyline) 10 mg once daily for 10 days.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Doctor: Hello. According to the history provided, here you are having a headache, dizziness mainly. Your blood pressure should be checked as fluctuations in blood pressure or high blood pressure can lead to a headache. Second otological causes should be evaluated as an ear infection can lead to a headache with dizziness. Viral respiratory tract infection can lead to a headache with dizziness (in this case congestive symptoms are present). If you are taking the stress and if having smoking habits than also headache can occur. Any cardiac history positive then less blood flow to the brain sometimes can lead to dizziness. For that investigation is done with EKG. If slurred speech is present, history of hypertension and if no specific cause found then CT scan like higher investigation can be done to look for the stroke-like condition. Take care.

You seem to have vasculitis which is inflammation of blood vessels in your eye which makes your blood vessels leaky. Injections of an anti-VEGF compound are indicated in this but before this, you need laser therapy in your eye along with a course of steroids. You need to undergo fundus fluorescein angiography to locate the area of leaky vessels and we have to laser it. You also need to get a blood investigation to rule out infections like tuberculosis. After that is ruled out, we have to start steroids. Anti-VEGF injections come after that. Kindly do not delay it if this process continues. The visual prognosis becomes poorer if not done in time. You may need surgery which would be more costly."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

If I would be the surgeon then I would have gone for operative treatment because intra-articular fractures need perfect reduction. If he has decided to treat it non operatively then he could have applied plaster or strapping which is not removable like your current splint."

I did see my doctor twice since my revision surgery and each time he seemed to be satisfied with the results. But, now I have not seen him again for six weeks. The area surrounding my belly button is discolored. I clearly have scarring. And, I just think it looks terrible and clearly indicates that I have had some type of surgery. Any suggestions or observations would be appreciated not only for the belly button itself but also for the discoloration. Doctor: Hello. First of all, I think the tummy tuck has come out well. The belly button however if it was not properly shaped during the initial procedure, then it was definitely a good decision to revise it after a few months. Right now, I feel that the skin is still in the healing phase. Given that it was a revision surgery, it will take a little longer to heal than a normal period of two months. Also, it depends upon the umbilical stalk length, that how long it will take for the surrounding induration and hence the discoloration to settle down. So for now, it is better to wait and watch."

I welcome you and want to assure you need not worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. The panurethral stricture is rather a less common but serious challenging surgical issue the urologists have to face.  2. This surgery is usually challenging as there is scanty tissue to cover the whole length of the urethra. Also as we know the reason for panurethral strictures is usually inflammatory disease, so the results of surgical repair may be less than expected on the scale of satisfaction. It is due to the spongiofibrosis of the repaired tissue.  3. During the post-operative period, infections and breakdown of the repaired tissue is commonly seen as a complication. But with all these risks, still this surgery is going on very successfully throughout the globe. If there is urinary tract infection your physician may prescribe you with Nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin). Take cranberry juice to avoid infection."

However, over the next couple weeks the numbing, tingling, moved to my right arm then my legs and feet to include muscle twitching/ spasms. Now, these symptoms have mostly left my arms other than occasional slight sensation in my fingers. However, my legs and left foot continue to have this sensation. I do not have any pain other than the sensation and can move normally. However, exerting myself seems to elevate the sensation. I visited my doctor and they ran a complete set of lab work and everything was normal other than slightly low vitamin D. Also scheduled to MRI on the spine to rule out MS. After doing some reading, I think I developed a case of peripheral neuropathy. My question is could this be something else? Is it possible that with rest it will go away? Are there any supplements I could take to help? Any other thoughts or suggestions? Doctor: Hello. I read your question carefully and would explain that your symptoms are not typical of a peripheral neuropathy. They could be related to a bulging disc in the cervical vertebral column. That is why it is necessary to perform a cervical spine MRI study. MS (multiple sclerosis) would be an exceptional diagnosis at your age. Vitamin D deficiency may lead to muscle twitching and also joint pain, associated with chronic fatigue. As it resulted low, it is necessary to take vitamin D supplements. I would also like to know if you checked vitamin B12 levels and thyroid hormone levels. Vitamin B12 deficiency can mimic this clinical situation. Regarding peripheral neuropathy, I would recommend performing a nerve conduction study (electroneurography) to exclude this possibility, although it is really less likely that you suffer from this disorder.

Firstly, your apprehension and concern are completely understandable. But the fact that you both were involved in sex after two days post her menses had stopped simply puts her in her safe period when chances of pregnancy are minimal as ovulation had not taken place. Secondly, there was no ejaculation involved before you fingered her and also you touched just the prepuce skin before fingering, again decreases her chances of pregnancy. Thirdly, you ejaculated over her butt and before the sperm could trickle to her vagina, you wiped it off. In this case as well, chances of pregnancy are minimal and do not qualify for any need for an emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hours of sex. As there was no unprotected intercourse involved, so you can be sure that there are no chances of pregnancy in this situation."

The next line of action should be an ultrasound of the abscess to look for extent. Also, drainage of abscess is necessary. She has enough antibiotics and, fever, TLC (total leucocyte count) not responding as antibiotics must not be reaching there adequately due to pus collection. So the abscess should be drained in my opinion while antibiotics should be continued.  After draining, the pus should be sent for investigations, which includes gram staining, AFB (acid-fast bacilli) staining, GenXpert of the pus, bacterial culture and sensitivity. So if the facility is available there then you may keep or else should be shifted to higher center.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,  I have a question with respect to Doxypal DL medicine and my question is whether the delayed release remains active when I would open a capsule to remove half of the pellets. The capsules are 100 mg, and I would like to take 50 mg, but I need the delayed release to remain working because otherwise, I get too many side effects with nausea. The side effects are also the reason I would like to take 50 mg two times a day instead of 100 mg once a day. I investigate and found that the delayed-release mechanism can be in the capsule (and if this is the case, I cannot open it, to remove half of the pellets, because it will loose the delayed release mechanism). But I read on the internet that the delayed-release mechanism can also be in the pellets inside of the capsule. If this is the case, I could open it, and remove half of the pellets, and the delayed-release mechanism would still be working. I want to know is the delayed-release mechanism of Doxypal 100mg RL contained in the pellets or is it due to the capsules?  Doctor: Hello. The delayed-release capsule contains the active drug (Doxycycline) and few other excipients that slowly release the active drug from it. So, the active drug is mixed with the excipients and put into the capsule. So, if you divide the capsule into equal half, it still works. Still, it is delayed-release and you can make 50 mg dosage.  You also see that whether the infection in acne is controlled with 50 mg dose. If so, you can follow it. If not controlled, then 100 mg must be taken. The benefit and side effects should be weighed to choose the balanced dosage."

It is mostly external rotation of my shoulder. Doctor: Hello. Your shoulder mobility issue could be mainly due to flexibility and stability issues associated with the shoulder girdle. This could be more pronounced, especially playing a sport involved in throwing, as the flexibility is always compromised due to stability and more mobility in the joint. Do not worry as this can be fixed easily with a couple of stretches like posterior capsule stretch and rotator cuff stretches like sleeper stretch. Keep doing this stretches and do some stability exercises. That will fix your problem once for all. Hope this is helpful for you. Kindly revert in case you need any further help in this regard.

Do not check for bleeding in every 10 minutes, and it causes to bleed more only. 6. You can have normal temperature meal only. Hot and hard edible things should be avoided for one day. 7. If bleeding still does not get better, then go to your dentist. Otherwise, it will be fine in a day.Give me a follow-up after 24 hours. I will guide you further if needed."

I have 3 years old child and completely normal. However, no test of this type was done earlier. Doctor: Hi. Heartiest congratulations for your second pregnancy. Well, there is a generalized increased risk with increased age of mother. You are above 35 years, so considering it as an elderly pregnancy, increased surveillance for congenital or chromosomal abnormalities in the baby are mandatory. These tests are nowadays routinely done even in younger mothers. According to your blood tests and USG findings (attachment removed to protect patient identity), you are on lower risk, that is, 1 in 10000, while as per your age it is a bit high risk, which is why the test was offered. Preferably you can opt for second-trimester quadruple blood tests during 15 to 18 weeks as well to keep you relaxed and finally do an TIFFA scan at around 20 to 22 weeks. They rule out around 95 % chance of missing out any chromosomal defect, if all done together. But, I want to add at the end, no test has 100 % success rate in diagnosing all congenital defects."

Now it started spreading to another ear. I have gone to many ENT specialist and dermatologist, and they could not be able to figure out what it is. It began as a small dot or spot 17 months ago in the left ear and started becoming a hole. We noticed it in the right ear around seven months ago. The same way it started as a dot as seen in the right ear before it turned into a small hole as seen in the left ear. The one on the left ear is 17 months now. We have been to many ENT specialist and dermatologist, and they said they had not seen such thing before. They conducted a blood test on him and said everything is fine. It is disturbing me a lot and looking for a solution for it as I am scared, that it should not get bigger. I am using Fusibact ointment on the affected area. Doctor: Hi. With your description and after reviewing the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I can think of a condition called angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE). It is a benign harmless condition that presents with bumps in the ears. ALHE is common in adults, but there are few cases of ALHE reported in children as well. This is an idiopathic condition, meaning the cause is not yet known. This condition has to be confirmed by skin biopsy. I understand it is difficult to do a biopsy in kids, but I feel biopsy is essential because this problem is present since 17months as you have mentioned. In about 20 % of cases, there will be elevated eosinophils in the blood. You have told that the blood tests are fine. I am not sure if the eosinophils were tested.

I feel sleepy all the time even after 8 to 10 hours of sleep.  No confidence.  I want to fix all these issues at the earliest as these are affecting me badly along with my work life. Please advise. Doctor: Hi. I read your query and understand your concerns. From the available description, it appears to me that you have a partial response to medication leading to incomplete treatment. Considering this fact we have two options to manage the current condition. Either to increase the dose of Fluoxetine to 40 mg, wait for three weeks before taking next step or to add Bupropion 300 mg per day with Fluoxetine 20 mg. As there is no motivation, emotional numbing and loss of interest in all things with a decreased energy, I feel the second option is more suitable for you. The dose is often started at 150 mg per day to be taken in morning and increased to 300 mg after four to seven days of initial treatment. This is prescription only medication and you may require a prescription for buying it from the pharmacy.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I have postnatal anxiety and my main worry is the hard car seat and regret that I did not buy a new one. Doctor: Hello. In my opinion, it may not have caused any harm, as far as your daughter is walking well, no gait issue, and no complains of pain over hip joints. Kids cells have higher regeneration power compared to adults. Theoretically, one can take a biopsy of a particular site and see under the microscope for any change, but in my opinion, it will be useless, and practically does not add value to the outcome. I will suggest, focus on involving her in a safe sports activity where hip mobility can be ensured. Do not blame yourself. You and your sister did it in good faith. The baby will be alright.

You have done a right thing by taking i-pill within 72 hours of last sexual intercourse. You were not likely to menstruate on your actual due date simply because it takes about 5-7 days for bleeding to occur after taking i-pill. It is also a known side effect of i-pill that the following menses may be delayed or may be heavy. In case periods do not resume in the next 10 days, then you must do a urine pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. If the test comes as negative, then please do not take any medication. Just wait for your periods to return, till then practise barrier contraception. If the test is positive which is unlikely though, keeping in mind that i-pill does not cause any congenital abnormalities in fetus, you would need to make an informed decision as to continue or terminate the pregnancy (which can be done by medical methods in early first trimester after ultrasound scan confirmation).

Do you have any headaches while observing these flashes? Or some local cause in eye can cause flashes. Sometimes jelly in the back of eye starts liquefying and detaches or pulls the retina that can cause flashes of light. This liquefacation of vitreous and its detachment is an aging process but it can occur in young people after some trauma, in high myopia (using minus glasses), or any surgery. This process is called posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). Sometimes (not always) PVD can be associated with a break in retina that can cause floaters or curtain in the vision.

The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

This would not be an issue relatively however I believe that my rapid weightloss was due to extreme stress and was mostly psychological. It seems to me that my practitioner should have advised me that gallstones occur commonly when rapid weight loss occurs. Furthermore, I believe that I could have benefited much more from keeping my gallbladder on a rigorous healthy diet and prescribing a biliary control. The latter that has taken place has resulted in a year long constant struggle to be happy and healthy. Doctor: Hello. Well, I understand that a year back you have been diagnosed with gallbladder dyskinesia or dysmotility as reported by HIDA scan. I was wondering whether you have weight loss as the only primary symptom or associated with abdominal pain. Because gallbladder dyskinesia most commonly causes pain and diarrhea rather simply weight loss. Or one should have to have evidence that the weight loss was due to gallbladder dyskinesia and not otherwise, then surgery was probably the right decision. I cannot figure out whether you have other symptoms or not. And now what sort of typical symptoms you feel suggesting you as postcholecystectomy syndrome (PCS). I can understand actually that symptoms of PCS can be at times very distressing and unbearable. The common symptoms are bloating after meal, freqeunt reflux or pain in the upper part of the belly, diarrhea after meals or sometimes otherwise, and this even can cause weight loss. This syndrome basically occurs secondary to an excessive pool of bile stored within a small bowel instead of gallbladder which is otherwise a sole bile reservoir. But PCS usually resolves within some time the maximum it can take is two to three years until the time your small intestine is adapted to it. You can try tablet Cholestyramine 4 gm twice daily 1 hour before meal or 4 hours before meals. This is a bile sequestrant and will bind and remove excessive bile from the gut. To be honest, I still do not understand the reason for your surgery year back but cannot completely argue with physician because I was not and he was the best person to decide while understanding your condition at that time. Postcholecystectomy syndrome. Follow up in two weeks."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

      "tgt": "My periods have become irregular. Will IVF help me?",
      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, My highest FSH count was 35.6 mIU/mL before two years. Now the FSH count is 13.2 mIU/mL. Before two years, my AMH count was 0.6 ng/ml. Last year, my AMH count was 0.1 ng/ml. Also, on the day seven and day 10, the follicular study gave nil result in both the ovaries (without medication). My periods have become irregular. I want to know whether IVF will give me success. Doctor: Hi. Let me start by giving you some points about the functions of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and AMH (anti-mullerian hormone). Every lady is born with a fixed number of eggs in ovaries (to be precise around 7 million). Every month, the lady pushes out one egg. These are the best of all. So after every period, the number of eggs left behind is less healthy than the previous cycle. By 35 years of age, most of the good eggs are gone and by 40 years nearly all the good eggs are over. This is not a fixed number. It is only a range. Pituitary gland below the brain produces FSH, which has a normal range of up to 7 mIU/mL. FSH stimulates the ovaries to release the eggs. As the eggs reduce, the higher levels of FSH is needed to release the eggs. So, indirectly FSH reflects the number of eggs left in the ovaries. Once, the number of eggs reduce, it can never be increased again. AMH above 2 ng/ml is normal. AMH is a glycoprotein which prevents the eggs releasing from the ovaries. So as the eggs reduce, the AMH level reduces. So there is no treatment to increase the AMH. Periods are irregular as the good eggs are nearly over and the hormones are reduced. Your best and the only option is IVF (in-vitro fertilization). I advise IVF with a donor egg is the only option. Anyone who is willing to give eggs, related or unrelated to you, can be given hormone injections. They will produce all the eggs, which can be aspirated in the embryology. Your husband's sperm can be injected into the eggs and the embryo is formed. The embryo is placed in a frozen. Those embryos are placed in your uterus and the baby will grow in your uterus. Even after the first delivery, you can plan for a second baby, a few years later. On the other hand, if you plan to use your own eggs, as explained previously, the chances of getting unhealthy eggs is more. The overall number of eggs too will be less, so the success of IVF will be low. Even if you get pregnant, you will need a screening for lots of genetic problems in the baby. Just by using a higher dose of hormones, your egg quality will not improve. By using your eggs, success rates are decimal. Using donor with good egg quality, the success rate is 45 to 50 %.

My question is, in order to cure a vaginal yeast infection do I need to apply the antifungal cream externally along with the Diflucan? Or will the Diflucan alone take care of the external and internal infection? Doctor: Hi. I have gone through your history and understand your concern. It could be due to vaginitis caused by a fungal and bacterial infection. You have to take vaginal tablet as well as local application of cream. You can do one thing use plain candid cream and take antifungal and antibiotics for the same. Keep the area dry and clean and drink a lot of warm water and eat lots of vegetables and fruits. Avoid oily and spicy food. Take probiotics for the same."

I will advise you to get urine culture and antibiotic sensitivity done first only then choose a proper antibiotic. If Amoxicillin is not working that means bacteria could be resistant to it, yes you can stop it. Pyridium is a good urinary antiseptic, and yes it does interfere with urine examination, especially with culture. You can try syrup Citrasol (alkaliser) two tea spoon full thrice daily. Take a small water tub to mix some antiseptic like savlon (Cholhexidine) and sit inside it for five to10 minutes before taking a bath. Take plenty of water. Also get complete urine examination done.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Antidepressant take around two weeks to show their effect as this much time is required to make changes in chemicals present in the brain. The symptoms you mentioned are typical of depression. Stalopam (Escitalopram) and Uvox CR (Fluvoxamine) both are antidepressant from SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) group but somewhat different profile. In the next few days, you will see some relief as 10 days already passed since starting on Uvox CR. Also, check your thyroid status as you are already on Thyroxine75 mcg and check that this dose is sufficient or not.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, Nine years ago, I have had phacoemulsification and IOL implant on my left eye. Post surgery, I developed acute steroid induced ocular hypertension, which was resolved with IV drug treatment. Fast forward, I developed open angle glaucoma in both eyes and I am undergoing trabeculectomy for the right eye (non-phaco LASIK eye) and will undergo phaco in the trabeculectomy eye as well since there is a sign of a posterior subcapsular cataract. I am already on maximum medical therapy Xalatan, Cosopt, Alphagan-P and Diamox. The visual acuity is already bad on the right eye due to glaucoma; it is about 78% according to a recent visual field test. So, I am not too worried about that. I have been placed on Xalatan for almost half a year now on my left eye, which had phaco done. Vision is still good, but there appears to be a slight haze and the glare appears to worsen over the past few months after starting Xalatan. The IOP is now controlled to around 16 mmHg and with Diamox it has on occasion even lowered to 10 mmHg. Is it normal to develop posterior capsular opacification 9 years post phacoemulsification? I was told that there were some mild PCO before I started Xalatan, but is it possible that the introduction of Xalatan hastened its progression even faster? With glaucoma under control, would a PCO laser capsulotomy be any risk for me? I mean would this still be recommended or would I be better hold off the surgery? Doctor: Hi. Thank you for the detailed description of your diagnosis. For further information consult an eye care ophthalmologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/eye-care-ophthalmologist"

I have been taking Omega 3 capsules for two months as someone told me that it will help me for my skin, but I did not notice any changes. Now, one of my friends told me about skin whitening injections. When I searched for it on the internet, it is a treatment of 8 to 10 injections. I do not know whether it has some side effects or not. I can now notice the darker skin tone on my hands and face as compared to my body. Please suggest me some solution for this. Also, I am getting a\u00a0patchy beard. I used to trim my beard always. But, when I noticed this patch, then I shaved it for the first time. But, it is still the same. I have attached a picture with this message. Please have a look. It can be noticed lightly as I have shaved my beard four days back. Please help me out with my problems. Doctor: Hi. The darker skin tone can be attributed to tanning and also ones natural color. I therefore recommend you daily sunscreen, use it 20 minutes prior to going outside. Using a night cream like ISIS Neotone night serum everyday at night for two to three months will help, but you need to be regular. For additional skin whitening, you require skin treatment like skin whitening chemical peels and laser sessions to be honest. Secondly, the problem of loss of hair in the beard area is a common thing that I see in my practice. This requires a close up examination. In all likelihood it would be alopecia areata. We need to give serial injections and also apply a tube by the name of Tacroz Forte 0.1% (Tacrolimus) at night and apply sunscreen during the day. Both the treatments have to be done together for the beard to show the fastest results. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.

You need to use treatment for this condition regularly and it takes about 3 to 4 months to start showing the results as hair cycle itself takes this much time. Start the following medications: A. Tablet Finpecia/Propecia 1 mg, take one tablet once a day. B. Rogaine (Minoxidil) 5 % lotion apply 1 ml twice a day. C. Nizoral shampoo three days per week.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Since I have gone to medical college, I have dropped out of my focus.\u00a0I cannot focus on studies or any important work. I know that I am wasting time, but I cannot stop procrastinating. I just push deadlines and always worry about the result. I always go to my friend room to see if he is reading or not. If he is not, then I am happy. I become happy by seeing his failure to read, but I do not feel that I should myself read for my satisfaction. I am always concerned about what others doing. I try to read, but wander away into browsing and then repent the waste of my time. I know that \u00a0I am a good student and if I read I can do better than the average. But, I cannot read.

I cannot\u00a0stop myself from wasting time.\u00a0I would be really obliged if you would help me. Thank you. Doctor: Hi. The things you are facing are faced by a lot of medical students during their studies. Before medical exams they usually top the classes and score big. In medical school there are a lot of distractions and individuals usually give less time to study. But, that does not mean that they cease to remain intelligent. Lack of focus, distraction, poor concentration, etc., are the main causes of poor performance in studies. Thoughts what others are doing, seeing others if they are studying, etc., are occurring due to insecurities after poor studies. If your focus and concentration improve, then you will come out of these problems. Lack of interest in studies, poor focus, poor concentration, procrastinating, etc., could be occurring due to depression. Mild depression can lead to such symptoms. Treatment with SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) like Sertraline, Paroxetine, Escitalopram, etc., can help to reduce your bad thoughts and you should feel better. Apart from this I suggest Vitamin B12 and E supplements, which will help to improve the focus. SSRIs will improve the depressive thoughts and your focus will improve. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. Yoga and meditation also help to improve the focus and thus act as supplement to medicines. So, just do not remain depressed. Your symptoms will improve in no time. For further doubts consult a psychiatrist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/psychiatrist"

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease) is a hormonal disorder. In this, immature ovum becomes a cyst around the ovary. Further, it hampers the formation of a mature ovum. Initially, it can be managed naturally through ayurvedic medicines and yoga practices. Kalarchikai is a beneficial siddha medicine for PCOD. If you are feeling uncomfortable after taking this, then, you can stop this medicine. PCOD needs long-term medications as well as changes in lifestyle and food habits. I need USG (ultrasonography) of lower abdomen and thyroid profile investigation reports. Please upload it. You can take Hyponidd (Cassia Auriculata with Curcuma Longa) two tablets twice a day with warm water and M2-Tone syrup 10 ml (Ashoka with Ashwagandha) twice a day before food.

I passed carefully through your question and would explain that your symptoms do not seem to be related to any cardiac issues. Considering your age and the fact that you have no cardiovascular risk factors there is nothing to worry about your heart. Your heart rate and blood pressure fluctuations are quite normal during physical activity and do not indicate any serious cardiac condition. Costochondritis or inflammation can be the cause of your complaints. Anxiety may also trigger this clinical situation. I would recommend using painkillers. If the pain persists, I recommend performing a chest X-ray study, a cervical spine X-ray study, complete blood count, PCR (polymerase chain reaction), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) for inflammation.

I have a history of a previous mid-trimester miscarriage which was believed to be due to an incompetent cervix, and so have been on vaginal progesterone pessaries since I tested positive this time around. Last month, I had some PV bleeding. Scans at that time did not show an SCH. A week after the onset of the bleed, progesterone levels were found to be 6 and so I was started on tablet Duphaston 10 mg twice a day and a shot of Inj Proluton Depot 250 mg was given. Sadly, I developed light bleeding again last night and USG showed a small 1.1 cm collection suggestive of an SCH. I was given a shot of Inj. Proluton Depot 250 mg before being discharged from the ER. I am doubtful as to whether I should continue taking the Inj Innohep while I have the bleed or if I should stop. My rheumatologist thinks I should continue on with the LMWH in spite of the bleeding in view of positive immunological markers. However, My RE thinks otherwise. He says the previous miscarriage was not due to APS (the baby was fine when I went into labor) and so he did not feel there to be an absolute indication for Heparin for this pregnancy. But what about the positive ANA? Or the Lupus anticoagulant? Pre-pregnancy tests were as follows  ANA: Positive -Homogeneous >1:1280  Lupus anticoagulant: Negative  The rheumatologist wanted a repeat panel done and so the tests were done while I was pregnant.  ANA: Positive - Homogeneous >1:2560 ( Increased ) Lupus anticoagulant - Positive   In view of these test, Should I be continuing on with the LMWH? Should LMWH be continued even with the presence of an SCH or vaginal bleeding? Does the increase in ANA indicate a definitive immune response from my body to the pregnancy? Can Lupus become positive just weeks / few months after it was found to be negative? Doctor: Hello. How are you doing? I know it is a tough situation for you to decide. Do not panic. Relax, you are doing fine. Let me answer you one by one. 40 mg dose of LMW Heparin once a day is a prophylactic dose. Twice a day is a therapeutic dose. So just by getting once a day dosage, will not affect the hemorrhage. Just have a follow-up scan after a week to compare the size. If you have any severe abdominal pain or active fresh red bleed. Then stop the injection. If you are also on tablet Ecospirin, better stop it, as it causes more bleed. About the antibody levels. This is a reason why blood is tested for the antibodies before. A false high value can be due to the hormone imbalance in pregnancy. Do not bother about the rise. It will fade off. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more queries, All the best.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Today I consulted a surgeon and after checking he advised to go for surgery as he discovered fistula. Can you recommend me the Ayurvedic procedure of cure as I do not want to go with surgery and I have read on your website that with surgery there is a chance of recurrence? How longer does it take for the cure? What would be the process of therapy? Doctor: Hello. I just read your query. As you do not want to undergo a surgery, in Ayurveda, Kshar sutra procedure is performed for fistula in the anus. It is a procedure where a medicated thread is bound at your fistula site and after some days your treating physician will change it. Ultimately this thread will cut down the fistula tract as well as will also help in its healing. Along with this, your doctor may also prescribe you some medicines and you have to take treatment for avoiding constipation also. According to the condition of your fistula, he will let you know that for how long you have to bind this thread. Usually two to four weeks is the time period but time may vary according to patient to patient. It is a cost-effective treatment with minimal side effects and minimal chances of reoccurrence. You can know more about it from a nearby Ayurvedic hospital or Ayurvedic physician who perform this procedure.

Right before I fainted, I was feeling like I had to burp and I had lots of saliva in my mouth. My head was hurting and I felt dizzy. Then, I felt nauseous and was gagging like I had to throw up, But, I did not. I ran to the bathroom and the nauseous feeling went away, but I fainted and was passed out for a little over a minute, from what my friend said. Then, I heard them yell my name and I slowly woke up confused. I felt fine afterwards. I went to the doctor the next day and they said I had a concussion syndrome. But, the other symptoms were red flags and so I was referred to a neurologist. After three months of tests, as my MRI came out fine without any tumors or anything of the sort, and had two EEGs, he had diagnosed me with one type of potential seizure activity while asleep and another type in another area while awake. My first question is, is that possible?Also, the medicines prescribed earlier for migraine did no good for my daily pounding headaches, dizziness and faint spells. I only had two to three other episodes after that where I would randomly faint. Those were around 5 and 7 months ago. My new neurologist based on the other neurologist's diagnosis, prescribed Keppra (extended release) 750 mg and advised to take it daily. After three months, I need to have another EEG.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

What could be the cause? I had my menopause 1.5 years back, and I have type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, and asymptomatic cholelithiasis\u00a0from last 15 years. After consulting many experts, we got three views, first is to carry out a biopsy and D and C, in the absence of malignant cancer, then we do not need to opt for hysterectomy (even with the endometrial thickness of 9 mm). Second, is to remove the uterus and the cervix, but keep the ovaries, as ovaries still produce 20 to 30% of the required hormones even after menopause. Third, is to remove the uterus and ovaries altogether and carry out the biopsy through frozen section at the time of TLH. Which is the best option, and why? What happens to hormone productions (even if it is 20 to 30%) after removal of ovaries? If ovaries are removed, do we have to get HRT? I have enclosed an ultrasound of the lower abdomen, transvaginal ultrasound, pap smear, MRI of the pelvis, and blood reports. Doctor: Hi. I have seen all the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). First, D and C (dilation and curettage) with cervical biopsy with acetic acid or Lugol's iodine should be done as you have postmenopausal spotting with thickened endometrium of 9 mm, with associated risk factor that is diabetes. This is required to rule out malignancy. Also, an antibiotic course should be given. Once this test is normal, then serial ultrasound every three months can be done to check for the endometrium thickness. Or if symptoms continue then you can opt for a hysterectomy. Removal of ovaries after menopause can be done as hormone reduces significantly, the only problem with that may be postmenopausal symptoms like hot flushes, recurrent vaginitis, and osteoporosis, which we can deal symptomatically.

It is better to have it in a infections control center by a specialist. Have a urine analysis and urine culture as well. Collect all laboratory results and discuss here. Have strict local hygiene.

He has a high level of blood urea and creatinine. What are the steps can be taken now? Please suggest. Doctor: Hi. He has a worsening kidney function secondary to hypertension and diabetes. His hemoglobin is low, (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and it is 7.6 g/dL. I believe that it is low due to kidney failure and he also has a bladder infection. Consult a urologist soon and do these blood tests such as serum iron, ferritin levels, and TIBC (total iron binding capacity). You can also consult a nephrologist soon, and he also needs subcutaneous erythropoietin during this time. For infection, you can give him tablet Ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice daily for five days. He needs hemodialysis also, and I also recommend getting a fistula now. It would become mature in three to four months, and it helps in the future. Discuss with your cardiologist if the stents are placed, before discontinuing Brilinta (Ticagrelor) and continue taking Aspirin."

The first three days my maximum HR was 150 on the treadmill and I felt fine and I would do 40 minutes on it and today I only did 30 minutes because I started to feel a little dizzy and my HR went up to 158. Why is that? Doctor: Hello. I understand your concern. It is normal for the heart rate to go as high 300 bpm. You are exercising the wrong way for someone with your weight. You have to start exercising by taking a five-minute walk on the treadmill before gradually increasing the pace to a speed of 5/6 for 10 to 15 minutes. You should do this routine for two weeks before gradually increasing the duration to 20 minutes. Increase the speed gradually as you get used to. You get the dizzy feeling because your heart is having to pump more blood as you run, which it is not used to. You will over come this feeling as times goes on."

You may repeat the urinary routine microscopy test again and if the symptoms are still present, likely that you are resistant to Cephalexin and hence can be started on Nitrofurantoin 100 mg which is category B pregnancy drug and safe in pregnancy. It can be prophylactically taken daily once till delivery and then two weeks post-partum to avoid any chances of recurrent UTI during pregnancy and negating canes of preterm labor.

The protein is digested in our human body but is sometimes excreted when not digested properly or in excess quantity. The term which you are referring to, which is total protein count in blood, urine and saliva has totally different meaning in all the three mediums. Total protein count in blood changes with increased protein ingestion and already present muscle protein or any other protein breakdown inside the body whereas protein in urine or any excretory product is always when the degradation of protein has increased, which can be possible because of higher intake of protein or increased muscle breakdown due to some pathology inside the body.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Does it need surgery? Doctor: Hello. I have gone through your optomap. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The first (left eye) one seems fine. The second one (right eye) on your left-hand side has a few changes. It is a bit tricky to make assumptions based on images, but are you referring to the retinal elevation and hole and chrpe on to the left-hand side? There are a multitude of options to treat such a disease. Some doctors, with such a finding, might say that it is a small hole and localized elevation and especially if you yourself have no symptoms like flashing light or floating objects, might ask you to simply follow up with them and recommend observation. Others may recommend that you get laser or surgery done more so in case you have symptoms as mentioned above and if you have had any such incidents in your other eye, or have risk factors like a high power. So in summary, I can say that it mainly depends on the progress, your symptoms and the risk factors. I can assure you that observation for a retinal problem like yours can be done because it is not involving the center part (macula).

Having had treated similarly presenting patients at my practice, I want to tell you that it is not a cause of worry. Most often this condition is seen in individuals who have a geographical tongue, or as an early sign of jaundice or some other liver disorder. It has been noted at times due to the collection of skin cells that bind herbal pigments as in smokers. Most of such patients do not need any treatment except for good oral hygiene. You only need to have your serum bilirubin levels checked and be cautious if such discoloration extends to the white portion of the eyes or other skin areas. For proper restoration of normal color, one may use Hydrogen peroxide solution in diluted form for rinses and a good tongue cleaner. Please be assured that your problem has a good probability of getting better with simple measures as the coating is piled up surface cells and need no treatment unless some other features like those listed above appear. You might consider eliminating any medication for this purpose."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My 29 year\u00a0old\u00a0brother had a pacemaker placed three years ago after survival from a sudden cardiac arrest. Doctors found the cause of the cardiac arrest to be a ventricular fibrillation. Last week was the first time he received a shock from his pacemaker, that is, exactly three years after his first episode. My question is, whether we can find the root cause of his ventricular fibrillation. What is the best treatment for his case? Doctor: Hello. Ventricular fibrillation, the commonest cause is coronary artery disease. The other causes are dilated cardiomyopathy or low heart function. What is his ejection fraction? Low ejection fraction due to any reason like coronary artery disease or others can lead to ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. He should undergo angiography, and echocardiogram, if he has not already. His electrolyte levels should also be checked as it is a very important precipitator for ventricular fibrillation. In treatment, he should receive Cordarone (Amiodarone), and multiple other medicines depending upon the echocardiogram and angiography reports. Usually, patients get antiplatelets like Aspirin, Clopidogrel, ACE inhibitor like ramipril, and Spironolactone along with other medications. You can upload his reports if any so that I can opine on the cause. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,Today after a meal I had some food particles stuck in my top molar all the way in the back. I took my toothbrush and tried to scrub it out real well to get it. While brushing, I put the toothbrush real far back into my mouth to really try and clean that last molar. In the process, I jabbed the back of my mouth behind the molar a few times. A few times while brushing the underside of my tooth and going straight back and a few times brushing the outside of the tooth and accidentally pushing it further past the teeth. What is back there? And can hitting it a bunch of times cause any medical issues? I am a little worried. Doctor: Hello. I have been through your query and as far as I understood I came to a conclusion that if you go far behind your teeth bearing area there is hard and soft tissue which you may injure yourself. The region behind your third molar is: In case you push your toothbrush far behind, you may injure your soft tissue that may result in some feeble pain and a white spot appearance. In that case get a Dologel (Choline salicylate) ointment if it hurts. If it does not hurt, let it be as it is and it will heal within five days without any medication.

I have seen three doctors, my GP and two hospital doctors, who all say it is likely a benign headache or tension-type headache of some description. I have no other symptoms other than the pain. I was prescribed Naproxen 500 mg twice daily which helped for two weeks. Pain came back a week after stopping Naproxen, but more mild than before. Then went away for five days and returned. Now, Naproxen does not seem to help at all. Doctors have not been concerned enough to give me a scan, because I have no other symptoms and just the pain. Again, this has been going on for two months now and even on pain-free days while on naproxen I have still had brief one second flashes of pain at least a couple of times a day.\u00a0I have no sickness or nausea or dizziness. I do not have a history of migraine.There is no pain behind my eye or tearing. I also have no anxiety or tension issues in my personal life to attribute to a headache.\u00a0The pain is in my left temporal area. I feel some pressure, pinching pain and tightness. Sometimes, it is in the inner ear and sometimes I have pain on the top left of my head. Before I started the Naproxen, it was at its worst at bedtime when I laid down, but I slept pain free for a month while on the Naproxen. The pain is quite mild, but persistent. So, it is very annoying and always on my mind now that the Naproxen does not seem to work at all and I cannot rely on it for relief.\u00a0Why would naproxen suddenly stop working?

Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects.

I would certainly suggest you visit your GP or family doctor. You will need to undergo an ECG (electrocardiogram) of your heart to determine its underlying rhythm. You will need your blood pressure and heart rate checkup, along with your blood sugar level. Given that it has happened recurrently now, your doctor may want to send off some blood tests such as your blood count to check your hemoglobin level to make sure you are not anemic, along with your electrolyte levels to ensure that there are no endocrine abnormalities.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am a 22-year-old female diagnosed with SLE at age 18. I have a difficult time concentrating and keeping my focus on things that I have to do. On some days I have trouble falling asleep and almost every day I have trouble getting a good night's sleep. I feel myself tossing and turning throughout the night. I try to get an adequate amount of exercise in throughout the week and walk almost every day. I know that chronic diseases can lead to depression but I can honestly say that it is not knowing that I have a disease that makes me feel unhappy. I just feel like I am mentally unstable sometimes. Sometimes it feels that everyday life situations are a lot more stressful to me than they used to be. And I feel like I am always on the verge of a mental breakdown. I have been feeling depressed off and on for at least two years. My lupus has been totally under control with the Plaquenil that I take daily. My BP runs a slightly over the normal at about 125/84, resting pulse in low 70's and BS WDL. Doctor: Hello. I can understand what you are going through, and I will try to be as helpful as possible. There are two possibilities: 1. The depression is not because of lupus but comorbidity. This is likely if there is a family history of depression. 2. Plaquenil could have some contribution to your problems. Insomnia is a known side effect of it. So, you can try taking it in the morning if you are taking it at night. Also, there are case reports of mood changes secondary to Hydroxychloroquine. Since your lupus is so nicely controlled with Plaquenil, it would not be wise to stop the drug just because of this. What I will recommend is to take it, first thing in the morning. A good sleep could in itself have a mood stabilizing and elevating effect. If this does not help much, you could ask your doctor for an antidepressant which promotes sleep. Agomelatine is one such drug that comes to mind, but it needs regular liver check-ups and has interactions with Ciprofloxacin, Omeprazole, Lorazepam, and Fluvoxamine. I could not find a known interaction with Plaquenil but I think your rheumatologist is the ideal person to ask. If mood swings are your major issue, a mood stabilizer could help. Take care."

Birth control pills contain hormones and those hormones have side effects as well. Few people get more and few less. Tri-sprintec contains Ethinylestradiol and Norgestimate hormones. Heart attack, stroke, breast cancer, blood clot formation, headache, liver disease, high blood pressure, endometrial cancer and per vaginal bleeding are side effects of this drug which appears more intensely in smokers and those aged above 35 years. Regarding the usage of birth control pills, I suggest changing after some time even if you are asymptomatic as some of these have long-term side effects.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have done every test including the factor 5 and the conclusion was my constant driving. My biggest fear is obviously getting another blood clot which I know you can get one while taking Xarelto. Obviously, every ache and pain I think that I have another one. Sometimes, I do get mild cramping in my legs but it comes and goes. My biggest question is if I was to get another blood clot. Is basically the only thing that can be done is just continuing to take Xarelto? Doctor: Hello. Xarelto is the brand name for the generic drug Rivaroxaban. It blocks the activity of certain clotting factors in the blood. It is used to prevent or treat deep vein thrombosis in which blood clots form in the deep veins of the legs. This can lead to pulmonary embolism in certain cases as in yours and can be fatal. Your current medication comprising of Xarelto daily is a form of prophylaxis to prevent the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis. The dose is lower than that when you are being treated for deep vein thrombosis. There are other anticoagulants which can be used but Xarelto is preferred. If you were to get another episode of deep vein thrombosis, the treatment would differ. Deep vein thrombosis is associated with prolonged periods of inactivity, inherited clotting disorders, surgery, and certain cancers. Since in your case it is due to driving for prolonged periods, you could reduce that and try and walk around every 15 to 20 minutes. If you smoke, then you should stop that as well. Thank you.

If fever is persistently more than 100 F, give her syrup Meftal P 2.5 ml (Mefenamic acid 5 ml equals 100 mg) every six hourly. In between fever, do tepid sponging of the whole body. The whole purpose is to bring down the temperature so that she should not throw febrile convulsion. Which is very common in very young children with high-grade fever. Usually, fevers are viral fever and do not require antibiotics. Why was Ciprofloxacin given? Just check with the doctor, usually, in children, it is least advisable.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I have removed all the four wisdom tooth before nine years. I had a safe and successful operation. After removing my wisdom tooth, I started to have bad breath. Before the removal of wisdom tooth, I do not have this problem. Currently, I floss daily, and I brush my teeth twice a day. I am using mouthwash twice a day, and I also do salt water gargling after taking foods. Nothing helps me. What could the problem behind it? Please help. Doctor: Hi. You are maintaining your oral hygiene well. Having bad breath after extraction or surgery is quite common due to an open socket. But it generally disappears after a few days. There are other possibilities also. The first cause can be periodontitis. It is the inflammation of the periodontal ligament or the structure supporting the gums. Bad breath can also occur due to GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) because of chronic acidity. Infections in tonsils or other areas of the throat can also cause bad breath. Food impaction around the teeth also causes bad breath. You can consult a dentist for a checkup and try to rule out periodontitis. Try to see the presence of calculus and do scaling. After ruling out periodontitis, you can see a physician for other health-related problems."

I just recently had a cervical MRI for an unrelated issue and they said that the brain stem controls this area and was seen as normal on the MRI, so there is no concern. Doctor: Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that as long as your brain and cervical spine MRI are normal, there is no reason to panic. We can exclude MS or any serious disorders affecting the central nervous system. In my opinion, your symptoms could be related to a pinched nerve. An electrolyte imbalance can mimic this situation too. For this reason I would recommend checking thyroid hormone levels, vitamin B12 plasma levels, blood electrolytes."

Can I try to conceive this month right after a cervical polyp removal? The polyp is very small in the cervix. Doctor: Hi. If a cervical polyp is removed anytime, there will be some fresh blood. So it is not advisable to have any medication for pregnancy, in the same cycle as the removal. As blood is not a good medium for sperms, sperm motility is reduced or stopped by blood components. You can try for pregnancy, but when there is blood with a raw area in the cervical canal, sperm health may be reduced. You can have sexual contact after bleeding stops, usually which stops within 2 to 3 days. Next periods your chances will be better. Better use Clomid from the next cycle."

An X-ray of the erect abdomen can also be done to get an approximate judgment about the same. Another study that may need to be done would be a reflux study (since you have mentioned Zantac is no good).

My fissure was healed, but I was left with constant pain, itching and pricking sensation around the anus while walking. I was not able to walk normally. Every time, when I walk for around 5 minutes, I am developing pricking, itching and burning sensation around the anus. I do not have any fissure now, but my bowel movements are painful. I have even developed stretch marks around the anus. Since, it is a steroid cream, my doctor advised that it will take some time to recover. But, I am really scared and do not know what to do. My main point of concern is whether the skin will recover to normal or not. I just stopped using the steroid cream 1 year ago and now I am using only coconut oil. But, the itching and stinging still persists. Is there any possibility of skin thinning? How long will it take to recover? Doctor: Hello. Anal fissure develops due to erosion of anal mucosa during hard straining particularly in constipated person. This is the main cause for it. So, prevention or treatment of constipation is very important. Once the anal mucosa get eroded due to straining, then the normal healing process starts which is similar to healing after any wound on the skin. Continuous pricking sensation and itching is because of this healing process. During this natural process, the eroded mucosa is replaced by a fibrosed tissue. If this fibrous tissue goes little deep up to the muscle layer, which work during defecation, then it affects its function also. This is the reason for the feeling of continuous spasm like pain during sitting or walking. Anal fissure is an irreversible process because once fibrous tissue is developed then it cannot be returned to normal tissue. Anovate cream (combination of Phenylephrine, Lidocaine and Betamethasone) will help during active fissure (early stage of the fissure) and on healing (inflammation) to reduce symptoms. No, Anovate cream does not cause thinning of skin. You must stop using it as you do not have active fissure now. Even stop using coconut oil as it has only soothing effect. You can use only topical anesthetic agent like Lidocaine to get relief from the symptoms. Again, fissure can never be replaced by normal skin or mucosa. If the fissure is so severe and it affects daily routine life, then consider for surgery. I like to know more about your bowel habit and any other associated rectal condition like piles, which may also cause a fissure. Constipation. Piles. Topical anesthetic agent application. Avoid constipation. For further doubts consult a medical gastroenterologist online.---> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/medical-gastroenterologist"

My arthritis is currently being treated with Remicade. Last month, while in a temporary job I developed severe altitude sickness (SOB, fatigue, and confusion) followed by bronchitis (stuffy nose and productive cough). While there I needed to schedule a Remicade infusion and the doctor there said she heard crackles in my lungs and sent me for an immediate chest x-ray, high-resolution CT scan and a multitude of labs. To my surprise, I was diagnosed with RA, not PSA as my rheumatologist had diagnosed me before itself. Anyway, the radiology results state honeycomb lung damage amongst other ominous findings. At my follow up I was told I have RA-ILD. I am now back to my place and have no symptoms to alert me of any lung problems. I followed up with my PCP last week and she did not hear crackles in my lungs. My peak flow rate is 400 and my O2 sat is 100% at rest and 98% with fast walking. I will send my radiology report and lab results. My question is, can the latent TB lung scaring be misdiagnosed as RA-ILD or IPF? I would appreciate your opinion. Doctor: Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from chronic bronchitis with rheumatoid arthritis with recently diagnosed with RA related interstitial lung disease or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. You had a history of PTB and taking anti-tubercular drugs. You are concerned about your recent diagnosis based on HRCT chest whether it is RA-ILD/IPF or latent TB related complications for your past sufferings and now you feel a lot better. Your HRCT of chest reveals (attachment removed to protect patient identity), interstitial fibrosis characterized by peripheral traction bronchiectasis, irregular reticulation in all lobes, microtubules with calcification in mid and lower lungs, lower lobe predominant microcystic changes without significant ground glass opacifications, hilar calcified lymph nodes consistent with chronic granulomatous disease, and bronchial wall thickening bilaterally. Similar type of radiological findings can be found in post TB fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which includes two key components chronic bronchitis and emphysema, RA-ILD or IPF, etc. You may not tell your doctor about your previous history of Latent TB. For that reason his diagnosis was RA-ILD or IPF as you are suffering from RA. So he was not wrong as your radiological reports suggest the above mentioned differential diagnosis. Again, on high altitude, your doctor found crackles as you are suffering from COPD and it may be associated with infections that time and now it not heard as your infection was subsided."

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am a 31-year-old male. For the past four months, I have periodically experienced severe pain in my lower right abdomen and lower right back regions. The pain comes quickly and can last for a few hours, and is so severe that all I can do is lay down and writhe. I have never passed any stones that I am aware of. The pain is usually accompanied by the feeling of needing to urinate, as well as some diarrhea. When the pain begins to set in, I make a point to drink lots of water. I do not have health insurance, so I have not had any imaging done. I would greatly appreciate any input or recommendations. Doctor: Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Well, I understand you have pain with diarrhea and pain that lasts a few hours before it goes away. Listening to your history, it seems a few possibilities. The pain of intestinal loops affecting the cecum a part of large bowel or terminal ileum which is small bowel. The causes are many but given your age, there are possibilities of Crohn's, yersinia infection or Whipple, and lastly uncommon is intestinal tuberculosis. The other possibility is renal stones. It is not necessary to have stones in urine in person with renal stones. Thirdly, functional abdominal pain syndrome which is basically hypersensitivity of the intestine to food, stools, water, etc. This pain cannot cause weight loss however, the causes mentioned above can cause fever and weight loss.  The third often overlooked cause of pain is nerve entrapment pain. This is because of the compression of the nerve in between the muscles. You see the list of differentials can be shrunken after a good history. I want you to tell me more about your symptoms in context to the above-mentioned conditions as we then target the one or two and investigate specifically and then can suggest treatment for the underlying cause. Do not get afraid. It is completely possible that you may not have any of those, but this has to be excluded from close questioning particular to these conditions. I hope this helps. Intestinal inflammation. Functional hypersensitivity. Nerve entrapment pain. Renal stones. Follow up to discuss in detail and formulate a plan of action for management of the problem."

But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods? Doctor: Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

As I have to take Metyrapone\u00a0for Cushing's my doctor recommended stopping Yasmin. But if I stop it, I do not have period for months and I get acne all over my body.\u00a0What can I use instead of Yasmin in order to control PCOS? Can I get it cured by removing ovaries? Doctor: Hello. Metyrapone (Metopirone) is an orphan medication that holds the FDA approval (Food and Drug Administration) for the diagnosis of Cushing\u2019s syndrome and is occasionally used off-label for short-term treatment of Cushing\u2019s syndrome prior to surgery. Metyrapone prevents cortisol synthesis by inhibiting 11 \u03b2-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of deoxycortisol to cortisol. The restricted access and adverse reactions of Metyrapone are associated with increased androgen and mineralocorticoid production, which limits the use of this medication for the treatment of Cushing\u2019s syndrome. It can cause a negative feedback increase of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) leading to acne, hirsutism excessive male pattern hair growth, hyperkalemia. However, Yasmin (Drospirenone and Ethinyl Estradiol) is a low dose sequential pill which has been given to regularize your cycles. They really do not actually affect the cortisol levels due to Cushing's and not really interact with Metyrapone either. It is often associated with weight gain. So, for that you may opt for Ginette 35 (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Cyproterone acetate) tablet monthly for next 6 months to regularize cycles and balance hormones. There is no need at all for oophorectomy for PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). It is never indicated. It can be controlled by medication as advised and revised now.

If it is not sexually transmitted disease then it can be acne, Fordyce spots which develop when skin's pores are clogged with natural oil, called sebum, sweat, and dead skin, it can also cause infection. Pearly penile papules (PPP) is small, fleshy bumps that usually develop in gland penis in rows around the head of the penis. A skin tag is normal, and it happens as age advances.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

She is feeling a labor pain, but the doctor told that it is not labor pain, and she will not deliver now and wait for 15 days. Doctor gave Anafortan injection to reduce the pain. Is that safe? We are worried as some people suggested that Anafortan should not be given. Please help. We did an ultrasound scan and blood test, her hemoglobin level is 10.1. Doctor: Hello. As this is the first pregnancy, I would like to give a few general information. Now, after completion of the eighth month, there are mainly two types of pain which a female is going to perceive. 1) False labor pain and 2) Backache due to pregnancy itself. False labor pain: As pregnancy comes near the due date, the uterus starts paining. But there is no effect in the view of delivery. The pain is perceived by a woman but there is no opening of the mouth of uterus. The baby is fine and the doctor cannot get contration on seeing the abdomen. This type of pain followed by delivery pain in 10 to 15 days or more in the first pregnancy, and less than 10 days in 2nd or 3rd pregnancy. So you do not have to worry much about this pain as far as it is tolerable. As pregnancy advances due to the increased size of uterus and baby, which takes a space in the abdomen and compresses the spinal cord causig the pain. It is continuous in nature and will be relieved only after delivery. For this type of pain, sometimes we advise painkiller gel or tablet if it is not tolerable. You can also do a hot compress on the back. As far as Anafortan (combination of Camylofin and Paracetamol) is concerned, we avoid it as far as possible. But when it comes to one or two times, it is not harmful. When you are taking this drug continuously, especially in the ninth month, then only it is harmful. So you can take Anafortan (non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) once or twice if the pain is more and if it is not delivery pain. So do not worry with one injection. I hope this helps."

I am just very worried and really want all of this to be over with. Doctor: Hi. Your bleeding is unlikely be solely due to chlamydia infection. There is a possibility of cervical erosion or polyp which needs to be diagnosed by speculum examination and if needed, by ultrasound. If the pathology is found, needs to be treated differently. Regarding treatment of chlamydia infection, your sexual partner also needs to be tested and get treated to prevent reinfection.

Doctor: Hi. Looking at your clinical history and present symptoms, my opinion is as follows: 1. Chronic diarrhea is really difficult period. Patients with autoimmune disorders are very much prone to lymphomas and risk is always present. Previously probably, you were not diagnosed with autoimmune disorder and DLBCL was possibly your first diagnosis. Females are at a higher risk of autoimmune disorder, and can be present with localized or systemic manifestations. Infections would not usually present for this long and this amount of chronic diarrhea should be autoimmune. Rarely recurrent infection due to immune suppression, secondary to CHOP therapy could be present. 2. Investigations necessary are: Stool examination to rule out infections - bacterial or parasitic. Also any presence of blood requires evaluation. Fecal fat estimation can be done and if positive, points towards malnutrition. Colonoscopy to rule out ulcerative colitis or crohns disease (autoimmune disorders). Biopsy is necessary for confirmation. Other causes could be irritable bowel syndrome (if no cause is identified), or malabsorption disorders. Possibility are rare at this age. Get a colonoscopy and endoscopy done. If any ulcerations is seen, biopsy needs to be taken. Based on biopsy further treatment is essential. Biopsy can help in identifying, whether you require medical or surgical line of therapy. Do get a colonoscopy and stool examination done. Due to absence of reports, I cannot comment further. Take a fiber rich diet. Increased risk of malabsorption and malnutrition is going to be present along with decreased body fluid volume. Take good amount of fluids along with a balanced diet. Avoid unnecessary medications and drug interactions can also cause diarrhea (At present, difficult to suspect this long)."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Earlier, I had the problem of ringworm, but then after medication of Clotrimazole ointment and oral tablet Terbinafine, it was treated. After a couple of months of that problem, I noticed two weeks back, red rash on the ring of my glans and foreskin with burning sensation. I checked on the internet and used Clotrimazole ointment with FourDerm and Terbicip. It got subsided, but every time after a bath, it emerged. I also keep hygiene around my genitals and also washed it with warm water with salt. However, it did not get cured but remained controlled. Two days back, I consulted a dermatologist, and he suggested to stop all that and instead apply DK Gel and take AF 150 orally, one tablet every three days after dinner. It has become redder and has covered the complete foreskin with redness and swelling. I checked with the dermatologist, but he said it is due to the use of steroid FourDerm ointment, and that it will subside in 7 to 8 days. It burns and is too sensitive even if it touches the cloth. I am attaching a picture of my penis. Please help. Doctor: Hi. By your complaints and the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity), your concern is balanitis. What your dermatologist had suggested is appropriate. You are facing side effects due to potent steroid in FourDerm (combination of Chlorhexidine, Clobetasol, Miconazole, and Neomycin). You can continue what your dermatologist had suggested. I suggest applying DK gel (Miconazole) at bedtime and Efficort 0.127 % (Hydrocortisone) mild medicated steroid in the affected areas until redness subsides. Try taking Crocin (Paracetamol) 500 mg, as on required to reduce pain. AF 150 mg (Fluconazole), weekly once after dinner. This will help you. Do not worry.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am a 52-year-old male that has suffered from anxiety and anxiety attacks for years. About a year ago during a stressful time, it got worse. It seemed I was nervous all the time, apprehensive, basically felt terrible. This only made anxiety worse, etc. I take a low dose of Klonopin and really do not like to take that. My doctor prescribed SSRI which seemed to make things worse. All the time affecting my functioning with my job and whole life. Recently, I was diagnosed with subclinical hyperthyroid. Scans and uptake all appear normal. She wants to put me on a low-dose of anti-thyroid medicine. I am so confused because I do not like taking medications but want to feel better. Will this help and can you ease my anxiety over taking the medicines? Doctor: Hi. I have read your query. Anxiety requires a two-way approach for its management- psychotherapy, and medication. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you. Psychotherapy: This involves talking about your anxiety to a therapist so that you do not keep your fears to yourself. Not just a therapist, I feel you should talk about it with anyone you are comfortable with. You can make some lifestyle modifications too to help you. Be physically active. Develop a routine so that you are physically active most days of the week. Exercise is a powerful stress reducer. It may improve your mood and help you stay healthy. Start out slowly and gradually increase the amount and intensity of your activities. Quit smoking, cut down alcohol and drinking coffee. Both nicotine and caffeine can worsen anxiety. Use relaxation techniques like meditations. Keep calm and breathe. Self-talk helps too. Make sleep a priority. Eight hours of sleep is considered adequate. Eat healthy.  Medications: This requires trial and error to choose a medicine that you can tolerate well. I feel SSRI's are a good choice. Please take the medicines for at least a month to see if you have adapted to it before switching to another one. And if you feel better with Klonopin, you can choose to take it. Subclinical hyperthyroid: It is caused when the thyroid startshyperfunctioning but it is not detected clinically. Symptoms include palpitations, tremor, heat intolerance, sweating, nervousness, anxiety, reduced feeling of well-being, fear, hostility, and inability to concentrate. I feel your symptoms of anxiety are aggravated because of subclinical hyperthyroidism. So I would advise you to start taking antithyroid medicines as they would control the level of thyroid in the body and hence help in reducing the symptom."

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It even gets to the point where it wakes me up at night in agony depending on when I last had a bowel movement. My actual bum hole is worrying me as well. It started off as a little tear (fissure), now I have got a big tear with what looks like a skin tag hanging off it as doctors in the past have said. It cannot be a skin tag as if you look properly it is actually part of my bum hole as there is a part missing. Doctor: Hi. I feel very saddened of your symptoms. I have seen many patients with this problem, which causes unbearable pain and anxiety to them. You may be having either anal fissure or piles, but the treatment is almost similar. 1. Eat lot of vegetables and whole grains. Fiber will heal the problems quickly. 2. Eat a different fruit every day. Avoid spicy and oily foods. 3. Never forcefully defecate. This will increase the tear or hemorrhoid. Use your stool softener twice a day. 4. You can take an ayurvedic drug for a long time basis for complete healing like Pilex tablet twice a day for 3 to 4 months. 5. Take Calcium Dobesilate tablets at night for a month. 6. Buy Calcium Dobesilate containing hemorrhoidal cream. It has an applicator (a cone with hole in both ends), insert it into anus and press the tube morning and night. 7. Is your blood pressure under control? Sometimes increased blood pressure may also cause hemorrhoid or fissure. By doing this you can see your pain and other symptoms slowly relieved in two to three months. If the problem increases, please opt for surgery. It will give you faster recovery."

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, Approximately 15 years ago I underwent a catheter ablation procedure to fix an irregular heartbeat. It was cured. My question is that can a cardiologist, who did not do the ablation, see exactly what was done without seeing a report of the procedure? I am currently taking Symbicort 200. Doctor: Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that a cardiac MRI can reveal the site of fibrosis, which correlates with the ablated region, in the myocardial tissues. This way a cardiologist who examines the cardiac MRI even years after the procedure can localize exactly the region of ablation, without the ablation procedure report."

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

My ED may be mentally too, like libido, but I do not think that as much as a physical problem with blood flow. Please help. I did a test with that gel stuff on testicles and x-ray type thing and they said nothing wrong. Doctor: Hello. I would like to know a few information about your general health. Is ED present all the time or noticing association with anything particular? Do you take any medications in general or anything for ED? The most common cause for ED in your age is psychological. Any undue stress in life? Any family history of medical problems diabetes, cholesterol, etc? Do you have a partner? Any change in partner recently? Any relevance you notice either this? Also, I am not very sure what blue balls exactly describe. But seeing that you have had an ultrasound of scrotum, I think it is unrelated to ED. Scrotal scans are not relevant for ED. So need more information on how and why you had this? Stress, psychological. Check fasting lipids, glucose, thyroid and testosterone levels. Also need the reports of scans, consultation reports already done. ? Varicocele (incidental not a cause for present complaint). Anorgasmia. Dysejaculation. All these are far less likely. ED (erectile dysfunction). Ensure no stress, take help if needed. Reassure that ED due to pathological cause at this age is unheard of. Try a dose of drugs like Viagra, purely to see responset. It is not recommended as long term until we have further information. Relaxation techniques. Avoid stress. Reassure positively. Highly recommend to take proper urological consultation to work up properly either locally or online."

I am a glaucoma suspect based on the last eye exam. How hard is Albenza on the body? Is it generally well tolerated for many days? Do immediate side effects get better after a few days? Doctor: Hello. Albendazole 400 mg single star dose is enough for prophylactic deworming. 10 days course is not required. Usually, it is very safe and is well tolerated. A rare side effect is a seizure, that can happen if the worm is already lying dormant in your CNS. I generally prefer a three-day course of Mebendazole 100 mg twice daily as it does not enter CNS and so there are no changes of seizures. I hope it helps.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I am a 32 year old male nurse, and I started having tremors in my hands when holding small objects like needles and catheters, since 3 to 4 years. It made me anxious as the tremors got worse every time\u00a0I inject. Before, I had to hold my head still to hear the Korotkoff's sound while measuring BP. \u00a0I always used to feel my head shaking. I remember being a kid and trying to play flute\u00a0and trembling like crazy. My thyroid, calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, copper, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, GGT, CK, etc., are all normal. I got an ECG done a year back, and the reports said derivations in the muscles deltoid, biceps, common extensor of the fingers, and first inter-bone dorsal shows no signs of neurogenic or myogenic atrophy. My tremors get worse after exercise, and they are horrible when I am nervous. If I am opening a heavy door, the arm shakes, if I am doing push-ups or planks, my whole body trembles like crazy. If I need to push a little harder on the syringe while injection, the tremor starts. When I draw a medicine from a vial before administrating, I have to close my arms to elbows, so I do not tremble. I do not smoke\u00a0and drink, not even coffee or tea and eat the best I can. I am only taking Finasteride and topical Minoxidil for male hair loss from 10 years. I am very sad\u00a0because it is getting difficult to perform my job and no one in my family understands. I never missed one day in work, I have passed through three neurologists. The first diagnosed it as essential tremor, and asked me to take Primidone, it was horrible\u00a0and I had to quit. The second said that it was an\u00a0exacerbated physiologic tremor, and the prescription was Rivotril (Clonazepam). This diagnosis made me sad, as my family said over and over that it was all stress. Rivotril did calm me, but the tremor went on, so I quit it. The last neurologist after getting the electromyography said it was an essential tremor. I am confused now, as my mom trembles from hand but only when she is stressed. This tremor is not here all the time. When I\u00a0hold my arm on a table and get down to get something, my arm trembles instantly. My writing is fine, and I only have asthma, male alopecia, and a history of septoplasty. I took Valerian, phytotherapy, acupuncture, but nothing helped. Why do I have these tremors? I often feel my muscles tired, so I took vitamin D. The tiredness felt better but the tremor is still on. Is it essential tremor? Doctor: Hello. I hope this answers you, and If you have more questions feel free to write back.

My mother told me that maybe it is because of cold weather which I agreed. It is there for the past 11 years. I have never consulted any professionals about it since it does not look severe. However, I am curious what is this condition called. Doctor: Hi. Seasonal itch and swelling over the exterior parts of the palms, soles ear, nose occur due to a type of cold allergy called perniosis orchilblains. Lesions for increased itchy sweling occurs mainly during the start of cold weather and end of the cold weather when there is temperature change in the environment. I am not sure which part you are living in as you have not mention. Treatment for this is avoidance of cold exposure, wearing warm clothes. Calcium dobesilate gel twice daily. Diltiazem 30 mg tablet BD for 2 weeks during the lesions. For itching you use Loratadine10 mg once daily for two weeks or whenever there is itching. Apply aloevera moisturizing cream over the hands multiple times with rubbing of the hands and feet and the parts so that good circulation bring warm blood flows into those area."

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I do not know whether the vagina is normally red or not. But for some days in the evening, or after meals I used to feel a\u00a0burning sensation.

So, please help me with diet part to reduce pitta dosha. I have no acidity symptoms. Doctor: Hi. You continue both these drugs. I think the Thyronorm dose could be increased slightly after discussing with your clinician, which will reduce your lethargy. You also consume more cumin, turmeric, coriander, small onion, cardamom, in food. They can balance pitha. You buy Eclipta alba, dry it and store it. Daily you should add bringaraj 5 gm, jeera 5 gm in 150 ml of milk or water, boil for 20 minutes, then filter and drink. This needs to be done morning and night regularly. Prepare freshly every time. This will help in regulating the thyroid hormonal feedback system, give adequate energy and also balances three doshas (vaatha, pitha and kabha).

Doctor: Hello. An initially positive pregnancy test that later becomes negative can happen with very early miscarriages. Such miscarriages can occur with little or no initial blood loss. These are termed chemical pregnancies, as they are lost before they attach to the womb and before they grow big enough to see on ultrasound. Only the pregnancy hormone is detected. The fact that you have still not had your menses needs to be investigated. Although it may be normal to have a delayed return of ovulation and menses after a miscarriage. The same pregnancy hormone detected in the urine pregnancy test can be done by a blood test for greater accuracy. An ultrasound may also be beneficial to identify any other cause for your missed period and your abdominal pain. Did you have a history of irregular periods before this episode?

There are guidelines which have mentioned that four generation test can detect 95 % infections four weeks after exposure. Negative test after four weeks needs to be confirmed with the second test three months after exposure.

I suggest taking Aceclofenac 100 mg after food morning and night, in case you have severe pain; otherwise, no need. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicine with their consent. If you have acidity, I suggest Pantoprazole 40 mg once daily half an hour before food. For the inflammation/infection, you can take capsule Amoxicillin morning, noon and night after food for five days. But, these are symptomatic treatment. Kindly meet your dentist for the examination and treatment plan. If you have decreased mouth opening, then also, do not worry, these medicines will help relieve it. Consult your dentist as soon as possible. For more information consult a dentist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/dentist"

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

Now I am getting married in a few months. So I took a pre-marital checkup and the result was nil and non-reactive for HIV, HSV 1 AND 2, HCV, HBS, chlamydia, and syphilis. But I am worried about HPV. I did not get any warts but still, I am afraid. Are there any risk of HPV related cancers for me or my partner? Doctor: Hello. I have gone through your query. Presently there are no tests to confirm HPV (human papillomavirus) infection in males. Warts can develop even years after the infection is acquired, therefore it is never really possible to know whether you are infected or not unless you develop a clinically visible lesion. Since you never had any visible growths or warts on the genitalia during all these years, therefore, it is likely that you are free of infection and never even acquired it in the first instance. Regarding the risk of cancer, only certain types of HPV (e.g) HPV type 6, 11, 16, and 18 are associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer in females, and not in males. In females, PAP (Papanicolaou) smear can be performed every year to look for any atypical cells. I think you can go ahead with your marriage without any fears at this time because there is no way you can even know whether you are infected or not."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I had a third generation test using vitros eci post five to six weeks past exposure and tested negative. My doctor advised me to get a test at least after 10 weeks post-exposure for confirmation. I am pretty nervous regarding the same. Can you please advise me what are the chances of contracting HIV and do the symptoms definitely occur in every individual post-HIV contraction? Doctor: Hello. Firstly, risk depends upon whether that guy has HIV or not. If not then nothing to worry, but considering the second possibility, then some risk remains of transmission, but not cent percent. Now, if the test is negative after five to six weeks then it is unlikely for you to have HIV as majority of those who are exposed becomes positive within this period. Only a minority of patients develop delayed seroconversion. So considering overall status, I think, there is no need to worry about it and you are unlikely to have HIV. However, get tested after a few weeks to clear out doubt and be sure. So you should not worry now and get back to routine, and get tested at later date. I hope this helps."

Carboxyhemoglobin level is raised by various reasons, and the inhalation of carbon monoxide is one of the reason. Our body has many mechanism to increase carboxyhemoglobin level. For you and your wife, the level is normal, and nothing to worry. Lab to lab variation, intra-instrumental variation human physiological variations are the reason for different values at different time points. In case of carbon monoxide poisoning, breathing difficulties, bluish discoloration of body (blood) are commonly seen. In such case just inhalation of fresh air can be helpful. In such cases the carboxyhemoglobin level is higher (than your levels). So I suggest to leave the worry. Go for brisk walking in fresh air daily and practice pranayama to balance the carboxyhemoglobin levels. If you want to repeat the blood test, can be done after some days. If the value is not doubled (below the doubled level), then it is normal. If values are doubled or more, only then it is the toxic influence."

Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I had bronchitis and they did a chest x-ray, it showed my heart was enlarged. My primary doctor did an echo and the results are below. My family history, maternal grandfather died of a blood clot that went to his heart and caused a heart attack. Mother died after a heart valve surgery in the early '50s, right ventricular failure and she had pulmonary hypertension. My brother just had a triple bypass for blockages two weeks ago. My personal health issues are high blood pressure well-controlled, sleep apnea, morbid obesity, acid reflux, IBS, peripheral edema, small hiatal hernia, anxiety well controlled. My primary doctor said the echo results were nothing to be concerned with at this point and want to retest in a year. However, I had an echo done five years ago and none of these issues were present then. With family and personal history what do you think? Only symptoms would be intermittent palpitations (not too often) and SOB on greater exertion.Procedure: A complete two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram was performed (2D, spectral and color flow doppler). Interpretation: Summary: Contrast injection was performed due to suboptimal images. Left ventricular systolic function is normal. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is greater than 55%. There is a mild left ventricular hypertrophy present. Respiratory variation of the IVC indicates normal right atrial pressures. The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is a trace amount of mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid regurgitant signal is inadequate for evaluating right ventricular pressure. There is a trace tricuspid valve regurgitation. No hemodynamically significant valvular aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is present. There is no pericardial effusion. Left ventricle: The left ventricle is normal in size. There is no thrombus. There is mild left ventricular hypertrophy present. Left ventricular systolic function is normal. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is greater than 55%. The left ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricle: The right ventricle is normal in size. The right ventricular systolic function is normal. Atria: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Right atrial size is normal. Respiratory variation of the IVC indicates normal right atrial pressures. Mitral valve: The mitral valve leaflets appear normal. There is no evidence of stenosis, fluttering, or prolapse. There is a trace amount of mitral regurgitation. Tricuspid Valve: The tricuspid valve is normal. There is no tricuspid valve vegetation. No significant tricuspid stenosis. There is trace tricuspid valve regurgitation. The tricuspid regurgitant signal is inadequate for evaluating right ventricular pressure. Aortic valve: The aortic valve is trileaflet. There is no aortic valvular vegetation. No hemodynamically significant valvular aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is present. Pulmonic valve: The pulmonic valve leaflets are thin and pliable, valve motion is normal. There is no pulmonic valvular stenosis. There is trace of pulmonic valvular regurgitation. Great vessels: The aortic root is normal in size. Pericardium / pleural: There is no pericardial effusion. Thrombus / mass: No intracardiac masses identified.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I went to the ER a week ago for abdominal pain. A pregnancy test was performed and it was negative. An ultrasound scan was performed and they found two heterogeneous ovarian cysts, one on the right is 1.5 cm and the other on the left is 1.4 cm. There were multiple simple cysts. My endometrial lining was 6 mm. They said everything else looked good. I have a\u00a0history of ovarian cysts. Do heterogeneous cysts happen before or after ovulation? Do they impact menstruation? Also, what is the difference between heterogeneous and homogeneous ovarian cysts? Doctor: Hi. First of all, 1.5 cm and 1.4 cm are a very small size for a cyst. Because, in every cycle around ovulation one of your ovary makes around 3 cm follicle (cyst). In a sonography, if it looks clear without any shadow in the cyst, then it is homogeneous and when something is found floating in the cyst as echoes (shadow), then it is called heterogeneous. Homogeneous have clear fluid. In heterogeneous cyst, the shadow may be due to blood, pus cells, epithelial cells, other debris, hormones, enzymes or turbid fluid.  In 1.5 cm and 1.4 cm sized small cysts, it is not so much important that whether it is heterogeneous or homogeneous because it is mostly going to disappear around your period. Before ovulation, mostly follicles are with clear fluid. After ovulation, it may be homogeneous or heterogeneous with decreased size. Actually, it looks like disappearing follicle and not a cyst. A cyst can disturb your cycle only if it is of a bigger size and remains even after menstruation. Mostly it begins from unruptured follicle during ovulation and the size can be from 4 cm to 11 cm or even bigger in some case. This type of cyst requires treatment.

To exclude any valvular disorder, the cardiologist will auscultate your heart carefully, if he listens any abnormal sound he may advise echo, otherwise no need. Regarding palpitations, better have an ECG done at the time of symptoms or alternatively 24 hours ECG may be done. Avoid stress, anxiety, do regular exercise or brisk walk, reduce weight if you are overweight. Avoid any such thing people usually are addicted to. Reduce tea, coffee.

Other than feeling more anxious lately, I was wondering what could be the reason could be for louder or harder pulse (my wife can hear my heartbeat during intercourse) but not faster. My resting heart rate is 60 BPM, and heart rate during exercise is around 140. Doctor: Hello. I passed carefully through your medical history and would like to explain that your symptoms (palpitations and pulse feeling through the body) are not related to any specific heart disorder unless you have primary aortic valve insufficiency. When significant (moderate to severe) aortic insufficiency is present, the arterial pulse may be frequently pronounced and easily visible through the body parts. But this is not your case. Your symptoms could be just physical deconditioning due to lack of physical training. Anyway, a more definite opinion could be given after a direct review of your echo report.

I went to an allergic specialist for skin testing because my skin was so sensitive I reacted to everything. They then did the RAST test on me. Everything came out class 0 except for egg white, wheat, and oats being class 2 and milk, and hazelnut being class 1. Can these cause anaphylaxis? How accurate are the RAST test? I was put on an elimination diet but the hives are still there. I occasionally get angioedema with it also. Can angiodema cause anaphylaxis? As you can see I am so scared for my throat to close up that I am scared to eat anything. I have only been eating a couple of things daily and live off that. Doctor: Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. RAST is a highly accurate test. If the test is positive for a specific allergen, it shows that you are sensitized to that particular allergen. This means that you may mount an allergic response when you are exposed to that allergen. However, it does not mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to that substance and, nor does it mean that any reactions will be severe. If the test is negative, it means that one does not have the ability to mount an allergic reaction to that allergen and any symptoms one may be experiencing are probably not due to an allergic reaction to that substance. However, the results of the RAST need to be interpreted in conjunction with your clinical history. e.g the presence of allergy to some or few allergens which may possibly be present either in the environment or food does not necessarily mean that they are responsible for the symptoms because if they are not even present in the environment or food of an individual, then they are irrelevant. In your case, an elimination diet has not helped thus proving the fact that RAST test results should be carefully interpreted along with clinical history and does not necessarily mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to the substance that you tested. Angioedema is frequently associated with urticaria. Pathogenesis is the same for both urticaria as well as angioedema. The presence of angioedema does not always mean that it is a part of anaphylaxis. Angioedema can be a part of anaphylaxis in those individuals who have a severe allergic reaction to an allergen with high levels of antibodies circulating in the blood. Since you have only class 1 and 2 level antibodies therefore it is unlike that these antigens or allergens would cause anaphylaxis."

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

      "src": "Patient: Dear doctor,I am 29 years old and since two months, I am suffering from lower abdominal pain and burning of penis tip. The case is as follows: At first when I got this, I was having severe penis burning and a swollen meatus with abdominal pain. So, my GP gave me medicine for UTI and also gave few tests which included CBC, sugar test, urine routine and culture, sonography for abdomen and lower abdomen, PSA, and serum creatine which all came negative. But still, I was having lower abdomen pain and burning tip, now with a stinging sensation in the penis as well as in the anus. Since it was not going away, my GP referred me to a urologist who then said it is dysuria and gave me Levoflox 500 mg, Tizan, Paracetamol 650 and Lactulose solution for motion for five days. But still, the pain was not gone. So, the urologist said to see a surgeon for abdomen pain and a dermatologist for the red meatus. The dermatologist said I do not have any skin issue but still gave me antifungal tablets and an antiallergy with a cream. So, the redness of meatus came down and burning too, but the stinging sensation of the lower abdomen and the sting from the penis to anus was not gone as I could feel it every now and then and more when passing motion.After all this, then I visited the surgeon who checked me for a hernia and prostate. To confirm, he also referred me to a sonography B/L hernial region and color doppler scrotum as now the pain was in the testicle too and a stool test.I did the following test and result for a hernia was negative while for scrotum test it came as: The right spermatic cord is bulky and shows mildly increased vascularity s/o funiculitis. Right simple epidydimal cyst. Normal both testis.Now, the surgeon was not available. So, I went to my urologist with these reports and he gave me following medicine: Tablet Metrogyl 400 mg (Metronidazole) two times a day for five days.Tablet Doxycycline LB 100 (Doxycycline) twice daily after food for 14 days.Tablet Chymozal Forte DS thrice before food for five days.Tablet Dolo 650 (Paracetamol) thrice after food for five days. I was instructed to wear tight scrotal support. I am still feeling pain in right side and testicle seems to be swollen slightly. There is still burning in tip of my penis and stinging in the penis is there too. Now my question is why does this happen? I am little tensed and do not know what exactly this is and how long will it take to completely go. This is treatable, right? Will it re-occur again? I am really tensed. Please help. And the tight scrotal support has to be worn at night too? I request you to please help me with this. Doctor: Hello. Relax and do not worry. I have read everything and also seen the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Funiculitis is basically inflammation/infection of spermatic cord which lies above the testis. So, you have inflammation of spermatic cord. It usually occurs after urine infection. There are nerves in the spermatic cord and because of inflammation, these nerves are getting irritated. So, you are having tingling and other sensations. Your sensations may take some time to resolve like four to six weeks as the nerves require to heal. The medication given by your doctor is fine. Nothing to change. I will only suggest adding tablet Flavospas (Flavoxate) one tablet morning, afternoon and evening. It will help reduce sensations. Yes, if possible you need to wear scrotal support at night also. For further queries consult a urologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/urologist"

Prior I had been exercising an hour a day five days a week, no issue. Currently still aiming for five but symptoms will start out on my bike or on the treadmill.I had a gastric bypass 11 years back. I rarely get the hypoglycemia episode when I would eat sugar. History of insulin resistance. Glucose is always under 100. Insulin was 9 six months back. It was 6 two weeks ago, glucose was 88. Ferritin 15, d-20. Currently, I am having Neurontin 800 four times a day, Vyvanse 50 once daily. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it appears that you have hypoglycemic symptoms. First of all I would suggest that instead of doing finger prick testing of blood sugar it is preferable to do laboratory test for blood sugar. Secondly, there is an inpatient (after admission to the hospital) test to check your blood sugar after fasting for a required number of hours under observation.  C-peptide and proinsulin need to be measured as well. All these are inpatient tests to rule out any cause of hypoglycemia. Also, if you exercise it is expected that your blood sugar levels fall even though it is recent probably because you have improved in losing stored fat which was initially preventing this from happening. This can be improved if you eat complex carbohydrates like oatmeal, yogurt and fibrous fruits and nuts (if not allergic) before working out.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling.

Firstly, I would like to assure you that you do not have to worry because there is always a solution to your problem. Having said that, I would like to let you know that, it is very important for a doctor to have the area inspected and examined before reaching a conclusion, as you have mentioned presence of a lump. Therefore, you need to consult a surgeon in person and allow him to examine. Do not feel uneasy or worry about it at all. As of now, use Smuth ointment at the anal region. It helps in counteracting the pain and discomfort. Do a sitz bath twice daily. Sitz bath needs filling up of a tub with warm water and mixing in some salt in the water. You need to sit in the water for about 10 minutes twice daily. These would help ease the pain and fight your problem.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Any injection is available for its treatment or surgery? Doctor: Hello. Premature ejaculation is defined as ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation, before the patient desires and before or within one minute of penetration. There are two major reasons for premature ejaculation. Frequently, performance anxiety could be a cause of premature ejaculation. In that case, you can take deep breaths for two minutes before sex. It will relax you enough. If you still feel anxious, you can take tab Alprazolam 0.5 mg half an hour before sexual activity. Remind yourself that you are having sex for mutual pleasure and relaxation. It is not an ordeal or duty where you are supposed to be the performer. If it is due to excess sensitivity of the glans penis (front portion of the penis). The first technique is known as squeeze technique. In it, when you reach close to orgasm, you or your partner should squeeze on the ridge between the glans and the shaft of the penis till the erection subsides. Then begin with your sexual activity once again. Repeat this a few times before you finally ejaculate. This will increase your time to ejaculation and also give you some voluntary control. The second option is you can use Lignocaine spray. Spray once on the glans penis 15 minutes before sexual activity. It will reduce the extra sensitivity of the glans to the normal level. You can also use 4% Lignox jelly instead of spray. If these techniques are not working for you, you can consult a sexologist who will examine you physically to find the cause and advise accordingly."

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

One of the reasons for breathlessness can be a side effect of tablet Brilinta (Ticagrelor). It happens quite frequently in patients taking it (about 13 percent of the patients to be precise). But I would suggest you not to stop the drug until the breathlessness is quite severe because it is very important to keep the blood thin and the stent open. So he should continue taking Brilinta. Another reason for breathlessness can be decreased ejection fraction, pumping of his heart, water getting accumulated in the chest and hence the breathlessness. And to make sure that this is not the cause I want you to answer my few questions. Is he having any swelling in the feet? Is he having difficulty breathing when he lies down? Does he have a cough? If the answers to any of these questions are yes and to prevent the water from accumulating in the lungs you can add a diuretic which will make him do more urine and get the water out of the lungs. But to confirm it as soon as the COVID situation settles down, you can get an appointment with your doctor for a echocardiography and get it done. For numbness, it can be usually a sign of a neuropathy either due to nutrient deficiency or any metabolic disease. I would prescribe you a few drugs. Does he a have history of diabetes mellitus? Brilinta induces dyspnea. LV dysfunction. ECG. 2D echo. LV dysfunction. Brilinta induced dyspnea. Brilinta induced dyspnea. Tablet Torsemide 5 mg 1-0-0, Neurobion 0-1-0.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I have a cough at certain times almost every day due to post-nasal drip. I take allergy medication (Cetirizine) but it does not seem to help. I have tried other techniques like lavage and have tried thinning my mucus by drinking more water, as advised by all the medical web sites. All the explanations I read online say that post-nasal drip is caused by a thickening of the mucus, that the mucus membranes make about a quart a day of mucus, which normally is thin enough to slide down the throat unnoticed and ends up in the stomach, but if it is too thick it is noticeable and it ends up going down the windpipe and needs to be brought up through coughing. Here is what I do not understand, normally the passage that is open is the trachea. The epiglottis only closes when swallowing, and furthermore it is behind the esophagus, so why the thin mucus which is sliding down our throat unnoticed does not go down into our lungs? It makes no sense. If I do not notice it and thus do not consciously swallow it, how does it go down the esophagus? It should be the opposite. Please suggest. Doctor: Hi. I am so delighted to read your query. My initial thoughts were that you were kidding. But when I thought I realized how beautifully you have thought about the question. We need to know about mucociliary clearance, direction of mucus movement, closure of airway by the epiglottis/supraglottis and by the glottis. Mucociliary movement occurs towards the throat and that is what brings the mucus towards the throat. Like you said, when the mucus gets thick due to allergy or infection or rhinitis, one gets a feeling of the movement. Cilia are small brush like extensions from cells which beat in a particular direction so as to drive the mucus film over the cilia towards the throat. From the throat, the brush border epithelium, that is the ciliated columnar respiratory epithelium pushes the mucus towards the pyriform fossa preferentially. The epiglottis and aryepiglottic fold and the inter arytenoid region form the supraglottic closure which acts as the first check point towards aspirating one's own saliva. The next check point is the glottis or the vocal cords which remain closed to prevent aspiration in such times. When the mucus drip is constant and thick then some microaspirations occur due to the nature of the mucus as well as due to any lax behavior of the closures causing some cough or chest infection. You must understand that the vocal cords, trachea and the respiratory pathways further below are also lined by ciliated epithelium which also have a mucus layer on top of them. This mucus layer traps smaller particles which escape the upper airways and bring them away from alveoli. They also moisturize the air we inhale. In your case, you need to arrest the cause that is causing the thick mucus. That is inside the nose. You need a steroidal nasal spray, taken in a particular way for a few weeks. This supplemented with an antacid like Protonix and Cetrizine will provide you lasting relief. You should also take mucolite for a few days to lighten the mucus. Couple this with steam and plenty of water. Avoid exposure to sun, smoke, pollution, and dust."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

This can be taken twice daily in the morning and evening. 2. In severe cases, your doctor may prescribe you a short course of oral corticosteroids. 3. Use a medicated gentle cleansing lotion on your skin for bath like Cetaphil cleansing lotion. 4. Wear cotton clothes. Avoid allergens like pets, dust, etc. 1. If you find any causative factors such as any dietary substance, dust, exertion, etc., try to avoid it. 2. Apply calamine lotion over affected areas.

What is migrating motor complex, and how is it related to fasting with IBS? Doctor: Hello. Fasting is not better for IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). Fasting in IBS causes hypoglycemia, and further causes giddiness, so it cannot favor IBS. MMC (mucosal mast cell) is associated with IBS with autonomous dysfunction. Factors that reduce the IBS are stress reduction, avoid masala foods and take regular proper diet. I suggest taking tablet Librax (Chlordiazepoxide and Clidinium bromide) 10 mg two times a day along with Omeprazole for seven days before food. Take curd or yogurt daily to resolve the IBS and do meditation daily for about half an hour."

Doctor: Hello, I have worked through your query and understand your health issues. I assure you not worry as you have consulted the appropriate expert physician who will take care all of your medical concerns. Your aunts report suggests she has multiple noncancerous cysts i.e fibrocystic change of breast. They have categorised it through a score to show its level of malignancy. It is called BI-RADS (breast imaging reporting and data system) score, devised by American College of Radiology to standardize the breast sonography reporting universally in a more professional way. BI-RADS score 0 means benign lesions (no cancer) to BI-RADS score 5 means you have 95 % chances that this specific opacity being seen under Sonography is a cancer and you need to proceed for biopsy testing of this mass. Your aunt has score 5 mass at 11' O'clock position that means she has 95 % chances that this mass is a cancer. She also has lymph nodal thickenings (and it may be due to spread of the breast cancer to these lymph nodes in the axilla). But we have still to confirm it without doubt through biopsy of the lesion. I would advice you to go for biopsy of the left breast tissue from 11O'clock position and also a biopsy of the lymph nodes from axilla. Ask your treating physician to refer you for the same."

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures.

I have read that people have coughs after surgery. It is causing so much pain in my stomach. Doctor: Hello. In general anesthesia, a patient is put on ventilatory support as he cannot breathe during general anesthesia. To achieve this, we need to pass a tube, known as an endotracheal tube, down the throat to the lungs. This sometimes leads to some swelling or medically known as edema in the throat. Some patients are more sensitive than others, so they have the self-limiting cough till the edema subsides. You can take some throat lozenges apart from steam inhalation to help you. The cough will go once the edema subsides. Endotracheal intubation leading to airway edema. Upper respiratory tract infection. Symptomatic, with steam inhalation and throat lozenges.

It can have stillbirth, difficult delivery, intrauterine death, etc. Please contact maternal medicine consultant obstetrician and discuss your detailed history and treatment till now.

My height is 170 cm approximately and weight check found 62 kg. What can I do for ketone? Doctor: Hello. Ketones usually develop more often in T1 diabetes. Especially when there is no adequate insulin and glucose levels are higher than 300 to 350 mg. It is necessary to take adequate water to eliminate those through urine. Avoid exercise when ketones are present. Try and maintain closer to normal glucose levels. Check glucose levels at home more often (every 3 to 4 hours). There is no mention of what is the treatment with the dosage of various drugs, PP glucose level, and HbA1c %. You have to bring glucose in better control to prevent ketones developing. If proper care is not taken, there can be a further complication of developing diabetic ketoacidosis, a medical emergency. If you have any questions please do come back.

You can try some measures to prevent any harm to others and yourself. 1) Always cover your window and doors before going to bed. 2) Place an alarm on door and on windows. 3) Remain away from stress you can try some pranayam and meditation as well. 4) Exercise during day time so that you feel tired physically which leads to a deep sleep.

Please suggest me some creams, so that it should not show any side effects. Also, how long I should use it? If I use anything, then will it have any effect in case of pregnancy, etc? Please help me. Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/dermatologist"

On my lower left, I have a dry socket, which I am getting treated for via packing (at least I think that is what it is called). On the right side, healing is just fine, however, I noticed some white stuff lodged in the gum. I am not sure if it is food or scar tissue because when I tried to get it out with a toothpick, it did not come out very easily, so I left it alone. Is this food or scar tissue? It is mildly bothersome. I brush my teeth but know to be careful around the surgical sites so they do not get irritated. It seems like a lot of plaque builds up back there because of this, and I am not quite sure what to do. Also, there is a very small spot of red gums on the front side of my second molar. I put a bit of mouthwash on it with a toothpick and left it alone. I have two questions, what is the whitish stuff that feels like food trapped in my healing gum socket? And what is this small patch of irritated gum on my second molar? Any help is appreciated. I am currently on Celexa (for depression), 600 mg of Ibuprofen (for wisdom tooth pain). Doctor: Hi. As it is just one week of wisdom teeth extraction, the white stuff seems to be most probably healing tissue only. It is a normal appearance of healing tissue post-extraction. A white patch of irritated gum can be due to injury or ulceration that can be due to accidental injury with the extraction instrument or can be due to injury with a toothbrush or any hard food. You can apply Chlorhexidine gel over it. Do warm saline gargles, antiseptic mouthwash gargles and brush your teeth twice a day for keeping plaque and deposits less accumulated. I hope this helps."

My partner and I have tried lube but it does not help at all, I still experience pain. Doctor: Hi. Having vaginismus is just like having any other medical problem. The only difference is not many people talk about vaginismus. Not able to have sex can be emotionally exhausting and mentally disturbing but the good thing is that it is a completely curable condition. Treatment involves a combination of couple counseling, and pelvic floor physiotherapy which consists of a thorough pelvic floor examination along with complete objective history by certified pelvic floor physiotherapist following with some relaxation exercises (also called myofascial release) either with direct interaction or using vaginal dilators. Physiotherapy increases the chances of success up to 98%. Patients mostly do not even need medication to treat this condition. Anxiety-relieving medicine may be prescribed for some, but only if required. The primary treatment methods involve understanding the vagina and exploring it and slowly desensitizing it using vaginal dilators under the guidance of pelvic PT. For partners of vaginismus patients, wise advice would be to be more supportive, communicative, and sensitive. One\u2019s rock-solid support to their partner is crucial for the chance of a complete cure. Intimacy is important but there are many ways to express your love. Pleasure is not the result of just one move, take out the time to research, and learn about each other\u2019s bodies. Love and support is the key in such times."

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill.

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I had sex for the first time.\u00a0After that, I did not get my periods yet. I went to a gynecologist. She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods? Doctor: Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Also for the last 10 days, Panafcortelone 5 mg. From what I have read, the first three medications should not be taken together. I am after a second opinion, please. Doctor: Hi. There is no drug interaction between Phentermine (Duromine) and Perindopril (Idaprex). Duroxime (for weight loss) can increase blood pressure which will be counteracted by Idaprex (for high blood pressure). There is no drug interaction between Citalopram (for depression) and Idaprex. Citalopram has a serious drug interaction with Duromine. Citalopram may increase the effects of Phentermine, and side effects such as nervousness and anxiety. A rare but serious condition called the serotonin syndrome can occur that includes symptoms such as hallucination, seizure, extreme changes in blood pressure, increased heart rate, excessive sweating, shivering or shaking, blurred vision, muscle spasm or stiffness, and tremor. You should regularly consult with your doctor and do report if any of these symptoms occur. You have been prescribed Prednisolone (Panafcortelone). This might be for the renal failure. But Prednisolone is known to cause depression, weight gain, and high blood pressure itself. You must get clarified with the consulting doctor about the prescription of Prednisolone (why it has been prescribed). Additionally, consult about changing Perindopril to Fosinopril as Idaprex is primarily eliminated by the kidney and may accumulate in patients with renal impairment.

I read on the internet that hair can turn white even when vitamins or iron levels are low. If supplements are taken, can this problem be reduced? What kind of diet would help? Doctor: Hello. Graying of hair is not specifically due to a vitamin deficiency. If the rest of the body does not show any signs of a vitamin deficiency, then white hair is usually idiopathic. Many genetic and environmental factors play a role. Check if the water is polluted with salts and heavy metals. Except for cosmetic concerns, grey hair usually is not a sign of a disease. Oiling the hair with ayurvedic oils might help. Try to include Indian gooseberry (amla), green leafy vegetables, nuts and liver in your diet.

I had braces two years ago. I realized the recession when flossing and brushing my teeth. I am wondering if I have overflossed and hurt my gums because it bleeds sometimes too and worried if it is gingivitis. Does mouth wash help? I am considering getting it. Doctor: Hello. Gum recession is caused due to multiple reasons and one of them is gingivitis or periodontitis. The amount of recession as I see in your pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity) is very less and you need not to worry about it at all unless you experience sensitivity issues. There is no sign of any inflammation or infection in your gums and that is not the cause for recession. The probable cause for this in your case is a faulty tooth brushing which causes constant trauma to the teeth and gums. Applying excessive pressure on your toothbrush while brushing is the most common reason as people usually think this will make the teeth whiter but in fact, it only causes more harm. Following proper tooth brushing techniques will prevent further recession. Black triangles are caused usually due to deposits in the interdental areas. You can visit a periodontist to get this treated. We have a few options such as laser therapy for papilla regeneration and a few other minor surgical procedures to regrow the lost gums in between the tooth. To correct gum recession also you may ask the periodontist for the treatment options. They are commonly gum grafts, coronally advanced flap therapy, etc., which will bring you back your esthetics. These procedures are not majorly invasive and need not hesitate to get it done. However, if it does not cause you any trouble you need not get any procedures done other than regular scaling and maintaining hygiene. Also, remember to use only a soft toothbrush as hard bristles can cause more trauma and result in a further recession."

Somehow I lost flexibility and elasticity of the penis and loosen skin. At age 28, I was affected by depression and I take medicine Sizodon LS (Risperidone and Trihexyphenidyl) and Epcon 0.5 (Clonazepam). But now I stopped this medicine for about one year. I have already consulted a doctor and he asked me to get some tests done. He advised me to take Nano-Leo total sachet twice a day in milk for a month. He also advised me to do regular exercise and after month, I found some light difference in erection. But mild erection results are not satisfied, but still, I am not getting a triggering effect like I was having at my younger age. In my teenage, erection used to happen even by thought. But now I am not getting a proper erection after struggling on the bed. With my partner too the duration is very short. Without proper erection, I get discharged when I want to perform. I tried lots of Ayurveda medicine but not satisfactory. Please help. Lab reports attached. Doctor: Hello. I read your query with keen interest and understand your concerns. First of all, I like to inform you that masturbation is completely harmless process and not associated with any side effects. However, depression is one of the common causes of poor erections and it is possible that there is still some effect of it. In addition, the medication you used for treatment also causes an elevation of prolactin as a side effect. The high prolactin in turn causes loss of libido, erections, sexual desire among other side effects. I mean to say that both diseases, as well as its treatment, is somehow responsible for the loss of erections which are experienced by you for the last two to three years. Fortunately, all the attached blood reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) are normal and there is a little to worry in regard to tested blood and urine parameters. Regarding the management, I will request you to get the following blood tests and revert back to me. 1.Serum testosterone 2. Serum prolactin I also take this opportunity to inform you that a typical course of Nano-Leo total (L-Arginine and Zinc capsules) for sexual problem lasts for three months.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well. Doctor: Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

As a result of taking the pills, I have noticed a huge change in my body, I have gained weight particularly around my knees and thighs and stomach which I am unable to lose. I have also noticed the veins in my legs appear much bigger and closer to my skin, and feel some pressure in the bottom of my legs. I stopped taking Yasminelle about two months ago and there is still absolutely no improvement in these symptoms. What should I do? Is this normal? Will I lose the weight and will my symptoms go and if so how long will it take? I am extremely worried. Doctor: Hi. It is better to have a concern about newly appeared symptoms and better to search solution as well. Contraceptives are hormones and give side effects short and long term. That is why it is better to discuss one's personal health history and contraceptive suitability with your treating Gynecologist and will be able to avoid the side effects. Although you need one physician consultation as well, you also need to discuss your medical history in detail. Combined oral contraceptive can give you or increases risk of venous thromboembolism. Weight gain could be the result of progesterone intake as well but if body tends to become fat also, there it complicates drugs or hormonal side effects as well as attract complications. Normal BMI and weight help to have better life quality. Try to have daily exercise, walk, and yoga. Have a healthy diet, less salt, sugar, oil, and spice. Take plenty of water daily. Better to lose weight, it will reduce the risk of multiple health issues like polycystic ovaries, irregular periods, clot formation, hypertension, diabetes, etc. Have recreational activities and quit recreational drugs like cocaine, tobacco, etc., if you have been using."

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

A busy life will not have an impact on sexual life, though it adds to fatigue, at the same time, workaholic maturity increases with confidence. Consider taking either Sildenafil or Tadalafil. Tadalafil is long-acting, and it is best suited. You can keep taking the drug on SOS (save our soul) basis about one hour before sex. This will make erection harder, and it will increase the time too. Take 10 mg on alternate days and also take another tablet on the day of sexual intercourse. It helps to maintain an erection. Apart from medicines, you can think of taking supplements. Nano Leo has L-arginine. But I advise you take L-arginine in a dose of 1500 mg. Tantex Forte and Confido are herbal drugs. You can start taking these drugs one tablet each twice a day for two months. These are safe to use, and it does not cause serious side effects. Keep your blood pressure and blood sugar levels in normal range. Altered blood sugar levels and hypertension are the two main culprits for having a poor erection. With regular use of drugs, your sex life gets improved, and there is no need to worry."

Also she could notice blood in stool\u00a0(occasionally). So, we decided to visit a hospital and there she had a couple of tests including rectal scanning. After investigation, doctor informed us that she has been affected by second degree piles, skin-tag and fissure and hence laser surgery is inevitable. We are really worried. Is there any alternate treatment without surgery?\u00a0 Presently, an ayurvedic specialist (who is located near our village) has prescribed few medicines (mentioned below) for reducing the pain and itching but not for cure,\u00a0Hamamelis virginiana ointment at night (to be used on the affected area), ayurvedic medicine for internal intake like Arsohari lehyam and Smooth laxative.\u00a0 Could you please advise us with proper guidance? Is there any doctor to whom we can consult for a second opinion? My wife is a thyroid patient. Looking forward to your valuable suggestion. Doctor: Hello. I understand your concern. It seems like your wife has second degree hemorrhoids which has also led to her fissure. The good news is that it can be managed medically. The first line of management is medical management. Itching is a very common manifestation, which is also known as pruritus. There are certain guidelines:  Before all this you need to go and get yourself examined by a good reputed general surgeon in your area. Ayurveda is outside my field of expertise and I am not convinced about you using ayurvedic medicines to treat hemorrhoids at this stage. There are other various possibilties like rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, cryotherapy, etc. The doctor who examines her may advise a colonoscopy to find out the status of the fissure. My final advise to you is that her condition is treatable and you need not have to worry. She needs to be under a good surgeon. There are various other modalities, which can be decided based on her local findings.

Doctor told me that it is partially ear wax blockage. But, I do not think so. I did try to put olive oil. And also I did not suffer from cold or flu lately. Doctor: Hello. From the details you have given in your query it seems to me that it is indeed wax only. As it pushes against the eardrum and further increases the block when you smile, laugh or wink, it is more likely impacted wax than anything else. However, one can be sure of that only if you see inside through an otoscope. If the doctor looked in through an otoscope and then said it as ear wax then it is most probably correct. In such a case you may apply Soliwax or Waxsolve ear drops of five to six drops around five times a day for four to five days. After that get the pliable wax removed at an ENT clinic. However, if the doctor had not used an otoscope to see into the ear, then we cannot be sure about whether it is wax or anything else. Since you are ruling out nose and throat infection, the ear block can be due to any furuncle or localized infection in the ear canal which is blocking the canal and increases the occlusion when you smile, wink and laugh.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I have had issues with my left ear for the past two months. I normally clean my ears with peroxide. After I added drops of peroxide back last month, I noticed that when people spoke to me loudly I would hear wind sound in my ears. Also, my ears felt plugged and I heard thumping (heartbeat sound) in my ear. Two days ago, I attempted to clean my ear with a home irrigation system. I was able to dislodge a large piece of dried, white wax. My ear felt the best in a long time. I was hearing clearly and the sounds in my ear went away. Yesterday, my ear felt plugged again. So I irrigated my ear and nothing came out. But the plugged feeling and sound went away. This morning my ear felt plugged again, and I irrigated my ear and nothing came out. But my ear felt clear and the plugged feeling and sound went away. What is causing this issue? Why does it keep coming back? Doctor: Hi. It looks like your having a eustachian tube catarrh. This tube essentially ventilates both the ear and nose and in an event where this tube has got blocked, you might develop fullness and ringing sensation in the same ear. Self-cleaning your ear is the most dangerous thing you can ever do. Never introduce peroxide or any thing under doctor's advice as it can be disastrous considering the ear and it is related structures to be one the most sensitive regions in the body. Another possibility is that there could be some remnant wax in your ear which can be the reason for you developing this ringing sensation on a regular basis. You can consider using Soliwax ear drops three times a day for one week and then get the blob suctioned out by an ent specialist. Other than this, take tablet Sinarest (Acetaminophen, Chlorpheniramine, and pseudoephedrine) or its equivalent one tablet two times a day after food for the next 1 week. Otrivin nasal drops thrice daily for five days should help."

Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you. Doctor: Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience. Child will eat properly now as he has recovered from illness."

You can keep reducing the sugar content of the milk slowly slowly until you reach a stage where there is no sugar in the milk. Also, you can check for your current milk output to see if even little is there. If even a little is there, please give the child breast for sometime and if the child suckles, let him suckle. After removing from the breast you can give the child some top feeds. That way the child will not stay hungry and your milk output will also increase.

If after adopting all these, still, BP remains elevated, you may take medication after one month or so. Tablet Lisinopril 10 mg at bed time daily. Make sure your kidney function is normal before starting this medicine. This medicine may cause reduced BP in initial days. So, take it at bed time only.

I understand that you have been concerned for your facial skin. In order to prescribe the right remedy, I will need to understand the detailed history of your health which includes mental, emotional and physical health issues. Can you please tell me whether you feel the skin is dull when you are mentally stressed out or is this dullness all the time? Do you have any pimples or dark marks or scars on your face skin? Is your skin very dry or oily? Also, what do you exactly feel about your facial skin and how do you react to that emotion? If possible, kindly answer these questions. Just based on your history, I can prescribe you the following remedies. 1. Berberis Aquafolium mother tincture 10 drops mixed with half cup of tap water can be applied over the face for 30 minutes twice a day. Then wash it off with plain water. 2. Sulfur 200 C only one dose four pills or two drops in a spoon of water. No repetition of dose. Only one dose to be taken, then wait and watch for the effect of the remedy. If you have already used Berberis Aquafolium mother tincture, then kindly just use one dose of Sulfur 200 C. Kindly get back in a week."

      "src": "Patient: Hi doctor, I am a 22 year old female. I have a dusky skin that is brown skin. I want to become fair. Can I use Kojivit gel? Or any other dermoatology cream can I use? My hands are also brown in color and full of tan. Do you suggest any creams to get fair? I want to become fair as my marriage is going to get fixed by next year. Please suggest me some creams, so that it should not show any side effects. Also, how long I should use it? If I use anything, then will it have any effect in case of pregnancy, etc? Please help me. Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/dermatologist"

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance. Doctor: Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage? Doctor: Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My boyfriend works in navy. We just started dating and have mostly had long distance relationship because of our situation. I have never taken birth control and or ECP. I have always had an average 28-day cycle. However, between last two to three months, I took five emergency contraceptive pills. I know it is too much, and it is wrong to take that many, but due to our uncertain living situation, I had to do so. My cycle reached up to 37 days, and I visited a gynaecologist. She did a pregnancy test which came negative. She also checked to make sure I had no infection. I did have a uterus swelling. She advised me to wait and allow my body to bounce back to its normal cycle naturally. She said it would take anywhere between few days to three months for my periods to get back to normal. She also prescribed daily contraceptive pills. Anyways, I got my period within six days. Last month as we both had to leave, I did not start the daily contraceptive pill. I took another one ECP and got my periods as normal. As my periods were ending, we had sex, and I took another ECP. My next period was due at the end of the month. However, he made an impromptu flight to see me and happened to come on the day that I was expecting my periods. We had sex on that day. But he did not climax. And since I was due for my periods, I thought I should not take an ECP again because I did not want to mess up my already messed up hormones. However, I did not get my periods.\u00a0It is 11 days, and I took two pregnancy tests and both tests came negative. Please advise. Doctor: Hi. You already messed up your cycle, and you do not have any choice left now. You have to wait for your period. You will also have to do a repeat urine pregnancy test after every four to five days till you get your periods. The other option that you have is to take some birth control pills or progesterone tablets for few days and wait for the period after that. And do urine pregnancy test every four to five days till you get your periods. As you already messed up your cycle. It is tough to predict your ovulation time. If you do not get your period now, it may be that you are pregnant also. It is just early non-detectable level of hormones in urine. This is one possibility. The other is you just did not ovulate this time and because of that, your periods may get delayed this time. In that case, there will be no pregnancy. So I am asking for repeat test every four to five days. Sometimes irregular cycle will not become regular and ultimately with irregular cycle and irregular ovulation you will end up in infertility and may require treatment for pregnancy. So be serious about it, and it is not very hard also. Do consult a nearby specialist doctor, talk about available options, understand the merits and demerits of every method and do choose best according to your lifestyle and convenience.

But alcohol can increase the activity of sebaceous glands, and it makes the skin more oily. Your chest color is lighter than your face. It is normal as the face is always exposed more to sunlight when compared to the chest. You have seborrheic melanosis around your mouth. Seborrheic melanosis is due to excessive oil production from the sebaceous glands of the face. You can use topical Elidel 1 % cream (Pimecrolimus). Apply it to the dark area around the mouth at night. You can use a good sunscreen with SPF (sun protection factor) 50. Apply it to the face before 30 minutes when you are going out. Use Salicylic acid face wash to wash the excess oil present in the face."

First of all I would like to see her reports from the previous diagnosis and treatment and only then I would be convinced that it was a tumour. Secondly, from your point, it sounds that it was only a cervical polyp which is totally benign and after removal of it patient does not have any symptoms. And thirdly, pap smear does not detect cancer. It detects only early changes which Iead to cancer. So get relaxed now as nothing is wrong with your wife as she has given birth to three healthy kids.

Along those lines, what does a person typically experience after having their skull opened or a bone flap? Doctor: Hello. Regarding your concern, I would explain that there are a lot of ways that a neurosurgeon can reach the brain: 1. Craniectomy: Trepanation and excision of the skull, which is called open surgery. 2. Endoscopy, through a device like a tube with a camera, which is called closed surgery. 3. Gala knife, which is a radiation technique, to treat brain lesions without opening the skull, but through radiation therapy. 4. Transphenoidal excision, through the nose, in case of pituitary tumors. This method avoids trepanation and uses anatomical ways through the nasal bone. 5. Endovascular catheterization to treat brain aneurysm and other vascular malformations by inserting catheters in the jugular vein, without trephination of the skull. In all these cases, the patient experiences mild pain, mainly due to the wound, which is well dominated by Ibuprofen or Tylenol. So, just like other surgery but the main thing is that brain tissue does not hurt. So, nothing tremendous happens after surgery. Recovery is quite painless, compared to other types of surgery."

If it has been more than 15 days since last dose, you need to visit gynecologist to get one ultrasound done, as Meprate will be effective only if your endometrial thickness is good, \u2265 7mm. If it has been less than 15 days since last dose, you can wait. If there is strong suspicion of pregnancy no harm will be done by repeating pregnancy test.

The FESS surgery (functional endoscopic sinus surgery) you had was for nasal blockage and its consequences of auditory tube blockage and middle ear fluid retention.

Whenever I increase the dosage, the following day my anxiety symptoms increase. Also, I have myoclonus in my feet and hands. It occurs just one time for around 10 to 15 minutes.\u00a0Do you think that I am in danger by using those combinations of drugs? Also, are those muscle jerking, alarms of a potential seizure?

After the first month, I had hair fall in my scalp. This hair fall is increasing in numbers and I am losing more than 100 hair follicles now a days. I also want to point out that I use varioius essential oils with carrier oils in my scalp for more than two years. I have many questions, kindly provide me detailed information. Can I apply essential oils on my beard (peppermint, hibiscus, and castor oil) in the meantime of applying Minoxidil? Also recommend me some essential oil that are adrogenic nature. Does all the fallen hair in scalp during this Minoxidil period regrow and is there any natural way to stop this hair fall during this period? How long does this hair loss lasts and what is this cause for this hair loss since I am only using Minoxidil in my beard? Should I bald trim my head after this telogen phase. Since I have a long hair (6.2inch)? Will I lose my hair after stopping the Minoxidil usage? Doctor: Hello. Yes, you can apply but according to our science oil does not act on the roots. They will grow automatically nothing more you have to do. It can extend up to 6 months. Hair fall has nothing to do with the hair shaft. Minoxidil increases the blood flow of hair follicles in the scalp, this increase blood flow would persist as long as you are applying Minoxidil. Once stopped you will return to the same stage of hair loss as you would have been without Minoxidil. I hope this helps."

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

She informed us that this could be due to the fibroid, which was discovered today. To confirm that, I got a scan done in two different centers, and they also confirmed that she has an intramural fibroid of 1.5 cm. What are the complications that could happen due to this?

The result is my intercourse time has increased from two minutes up to 45 minutes without having ejaculation. With Priligy or Tramadol alone it is around a maximum of five minutes. My question is, can this dosage combined cause serotonin syndrome or is the dosage still at a moderate level? Would it help to reduce the risk if I reduce Tramadol to 5mg and Priligy to 30mg? Doctor: Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Serotonin syndrome will not occur when you consume high doses of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and then stop abruptly. My advice to you would be a safer way out. You should continue with Dapoxetine 60 mg and avoid Tramadol. If you do not get adequate time, then add up anesthetic jelly. You need to apply it on your penis 20 minutes prior to intercourse and wear a condom. You would get a wonderful time I am sure of that. I hope this helps."

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill.

Probable high-grade stenosis of the right common iliac artery and the bilateral common femoral artery. She also has kidney disease in the left kidney and extreme fatigue for two years. Would she be a candidate for a stent or some other procedure to unblock the artery? And could this condition be causing her fatigue? None of her doctors can figure out the reason for fatigue. Please help. Doctor: Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. This is a non-contrast CT (computed tomography) so it is not accurate in estimating the extent of stenosis. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  She will need a contrast CT angiography of abdominal vessels. However, the common iliac artery and femoral arteries are usually amenable to stenting, unless CT angiography shows diffuse disease (whole of the artery is involved with no normal segment) where stenting would be difficult. However, a disease involving these arteries is unlikely to cause generalized fatigue, but it can cause pain or weakness in the lower limbs while walking. Regarding the cause for fatigue, I guess the common causes like low hemoglobin, BP issues, any medications, deranged kidney function, low Vitamin D, deranged blood sugar are ruled out. One important cause that should be ruled out in her is the cardiac cause, because her CT scan shows mild fluid in bilateral lungs which may be related to heart and also with such extensive aortic disease, cardiac arteries are also expected to be involved. Cardiac disease may cause fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion. So, she should undergo ECG (electrocardiography), echo, and also CT angiography of heart vessels, if possible along with CT angiography of abdominal vessels. Also, some routine tests like hemogram, LFT (liver function test), RFT (renal function test), vitamin D, thyroid profile, sugar, lipid profile, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) should also be performed if not done recently.

If there is itching alone (especially involving palms and soles) without any skin rashes, it could be a condition called obstetric cholestasis. In obstetric cholestasis, the liver is unable to send out the waste product called bile acids, and they accumulate in the blood and get deposited in the skin leading to itching. This can be picked up by a simple blood test. It can affect the baby if the levels are too high. We generally deliver the baby by 37 weeks to avoid this.

Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you. Doctor: Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

We have been married since 3 years and have a 2 year old son.\u00a0Actually, she has faced the problem of vaginal dryness lately. As it could be due to lower levels of estradiol or perimenopausal symptoms, so we got the estradiol level check done. Although, the report has a reference range, we do not know if this level of the corresponding day is optimal or not. Please advice on this. Kindly\u00a0let us know regarding the estradiol levels in a healthy woman. Doctor: Hello. There are two major types of estrogen, the female sex hormone. They are estradiol and estrone. In younger woman, the first one is in abundant quantity and the second one is in less. And near menopause, the level just reverses. It means there is more production of estrone at menopause. The normal estradiol level in the second half in perimenopausal age varies between 39 to 300 pg/mL and it varies from different times of cycle. A level below 30 is definitely about menopause. Now, her level is within normal limit. Vaginal dryness is quite common due to the aging process as well as use of contraceptive pills. I suggest you to measure the level of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) to determine her menopausal status. However, at this estradiol level, she should not be advised for hormone replacement now. You may be benefited by the application of some gel or cream during intercourse.

An oily stool is normal with the medication you had taken. If you are already a diagnosed case of PCOS, consult a gynaecologist online and get it treated. PCOS is a cause for overweight. This might also cause unwanted facial hair, infertility etc., later in life. Since you are getting married, it is very important that you get this disease treated at the earliest. The vaginal bleeding needs clinical examination. An ultrasound scan has to be done and treated accordingly. Modify your diet if you are very particular about reducing weight. Cut down fats, sugars, oil, alcohol if any, non-vegetarian food, etc. Take a lot of fresh fruits, fresh juices, salads, soups, and green vegetables. Drink plenty of water.

But today, I touched it and it popped and began to bleed along with some pus. I was not too worried until I took a photo and saw two large holes like a spider bite and the area is a little tender after I cleaned it. Does it sound like it could be an infected spider bite? Doctor: Hi. It could very well be an infected spider bite. It could also be an infected follicle. Anyway, apply some antibiotic cream over it (Bacitracin or Fusiderm or Povidone iodine). Apply twice daily and clean the wound with warm water while bathing. Do not insert anything inside the ear though. If there are any worrisome changes please contact us. Like color change of rest of pinna, pain, tenderness, swelling, increased redness, spreading of the redness, etc. You may take Tylenol if there is pain. Oral antibiotics are not necessary. If you suffer from diabetes, hypertension, immunosuppression or cancer we need to be careful. In that case, do let us know."

Suggest me the best specialist doctor for this. Is there any serious problem now or in the future? Doctor: Hello. The reports you sent me do not show normal values beside the observed values (attachment removed to protect patient identity). From what I can understand, this would have been a case of viral meningitis. If the child did not have any serious life-threatening episode during this infection, it is less likely that there would be any damage done. As regards the future, since there were no convulsions, I feel not much damage has been done, so things should be fine. Continue other medications as going on. Consult a neurologist for the same.

I am having this feel for at least twice a month. I feel confused after and have also had a migraine lasting more than 24 hours after yesterday's seizure. It might be worth noting that I have also been feeling dizzy all week but this was before the seizure occurred and has now gone away. Doctor: Hi. Your description of the episode is typical of partial seizure. It is likely to be complex partial seizures because of the deja vu (already experienced feeling) and memory loss. Since you are having recurrent seizures, you are suffering from epilepsy. It needs to be investigated and you need to be started on an antiepileptic drug. Antiepileptic medicines like Oxcarbazepine dose of 10-15 mg/kg in two divided doses and Clobazam 5-10 mg, once a day are reasonable for first line medicine for complex partial epilepsy considering your age and gender. You also need to get an electroencephalogram (EEG) and MRI brain done to confirm the diagnosis and decide on proper line of management. You need to see a neurologist and start treatment soon to prevent further complications. EEG and MRI brain. Simple partial epilepsy. Complex partial epilepsy. Start antiepileptic medications like Oxcarbazepine and Clobazam. For further doubts consult a neurologist online.---> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/neurologist"

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, I am a 49 year old female, and I have a\u00a0uterine fibroid. I have heavy bleeding from two or three months. What to do? What medicines can I take? Is it curable without surgery? Please\u00a0advise. I am taking Kanchanar Guggulu from ten days. Doctor: Hi. The heavy bleeding may be due to the fibroid and menopausal symptoms. Hence, we need to treat fibroid and hormonal imbalance. For your condition, I suggest you try taking the following medicines. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. You need to continue these drugs for three months. Within one week, the bleeding will stop. Then gradually, the uterine fibroid will be reduced in size. After few more months, your uterus will become normal. If you can collect or buy the bark of jambul tree, crush 50 gm of the bark with 300 ml of water. Boil in mild flame, and reduce it to 50 ml. Then drink it. This should be consumed in the morning and evening on an empty stomach. This has the potential to stop the excess bleeding. Use banana flower in cooking. It is also good to control uterine bleeding. Another option is using hormones given by a gynecologist, but that should be your last option. This drug gives only symptomatic relief, it does not reduce the fibroid uterus size.

      "src": "Patient: Hello doctor, My friend undergoes frequent delusions and nightmares about some men raping her. She is 20 years old now. When she was around 10 years old, she went to a wedding ceremony. She made friends with a boy much older than her. He took her to someplace on the very same day telling her something nice and all. Then she saw four to five boys standing outside a dark construction site. She fainted then and after that, she only remembers waking up. She says that all these are coming back now because she is curious about what happened to her that night. Her delusions and nightmares were triggered by a rape scene she was seeing in a daily soap recently which made her remember the incident. What is worse is that if she gets to know what happened that night, and if it is really something that bad, she might commit suicide or hurt herself. Recently while I was at her place, talking about these problems, suddenly she felt dizzy and sat down, and then she stared intently at the entrance for at least five minutes if not ten, after which again she was normal but she does not know any part of the time when she was looking at the door and thinking something. I am very much worried about her. Please I need some advice about what can I do about and how can I help her? She is in so much of pain. Please help. Doctor: Hi. It appears more of an anxiety spectrum disorder rather than an actual delusion. Which antianxiety drug was started on her and what was the response? She might respond to a small dose of Escitalopram 10 mg at morning and 0.25 mg Clonazepam at night, if there are severe nightmares there is also an option of Prazosin 1 mg at night, you could meet a local psychiatrist for these. I would recommend you to not actively talk about the rape thing to her or do any online therapy since it can make her focus too much on the topic. Try to distract her and keep her engaged. Yoga and muscle relaxation exercises can help. If there is a clinical psychologist near your area, she can be started on a cognitive behavior therapy but again I would recommend the above options before trying it out."

Rapid acting analog insulin aspart is a safer choice along with diet and tolerable exercise. Diet and exercise are tried first. Nowadays, many of the guidelines allow Metformin in gestational diabetes.

I am depressed as I know that in those days, I will be lonely again and that fear is creating a problem in our relationship. Thus we fight too. I do not know what to do. Please help. Doctor: Hello. It is common to see one partner being outgoing and having lots of friends while the other has a limited social circle. The best way to minimize conflicts in a relationship is to be open and talk regularly to prevent the development of any deep-seated resentments. Have a honest discussion with your fiance about how you feel. Talk when both of you are calm, avoid discussing these during heated arguments as it will not be helpful. It is important to give some space, even in close relationships. Both of you will find it beneficial to spend time with family and friends regularly. Try to gradually develop your friendship circle so that you do not feel lonely. It may take some time and effort, but can be managed eventually. Utilize opportunities to attend social events, birthday parties, weddings, etc., to expand your social network. Develop some interesting hobbies to keep you occupied. Even reading books will be helpful. If you prefer the company of animals, try getting a pet dog or cat. If problems persist in your relationship, you can seek counseling."
