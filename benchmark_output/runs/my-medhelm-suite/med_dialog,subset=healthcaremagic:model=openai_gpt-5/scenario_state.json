If I am your suggestion giving Doctor I suggest you that you should not be worry regarding rabies. Rabies only spreads through damaged nerves, which happens in the case of biting by dogs. But it wont spread by biting of nails. But if suppose when you biting the nail you got injured the fingerbed you might be infected with rabies. But I think you have not injured your finger during biting the nail so do not worry regarding that. If you have anything else to ask kindly contact me Dr Arun Tank, Infectious Disease specialist."

Do you have fever/ watery diarrhea/ constipation/ spasmodic abdominal pain/ nausea or vomiting/ weight loss/ mucus discharge in stools?  Do you have any mass palpable in abdomen? Is there any aggravating or relieving factor for abdominal pain? With the available described symptoms, there could b possibility of peritonitis or muscular ache. You should consult with internal medicine specialist/ gastroenterologist and should go for thorough check up. You should go for complete blood count, urine routine microscopy, renal function test, serum amylase and lipase, colonoscopy, UGI endoscopy for better clarification. You should take low fat, spicy soft diet. Meanwhile, you should take antispasmodics along with proton pump inhibitors. Treatment depends on exact diagnosis. Take care, Dr. Mayank Bhargava\n</conversation>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nThe patient reported a sudden, severe sharp pain in the lower left abdomen with chest tightness and shortness of breath lasting about 20 minutes and then resolving, and the doctor queried GI symptoms, considered peritonitis versus a muscular cause, and advised prompt evaluation by internal medicine/gastroenterology with labs (CBC, urinalysis, renal function, amylase/lipase) and possible\n</response>\n\nThe reference response will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nHad pain in left side of stomach and pain while breathing for 20 minutes.

But he is not cured still his culture is positive. Please doc. suggest how he will be negative which medicine should be added to his regiment and how long he should take the kanamycin injection. Doctor: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Persistent positive culture even after taking MDR (MultiDrug Resistance) TB treatment is suggestive of possible XDR (extremely drug resistance) TB or TDR (total drug resistance) TB.So better to get done sputum culture and sensitivity for XDR TB.He might need capriomycin injection, moxifloxacin, high dose INH, rifabutin, cycloserine, moxifloxacin etc.No need to give kanamycin injection now. First rule out XDR TB.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks."

He is suffering from mdr tb last four year,he was infected in mumbai during his education he was direct infection case of mdr tb. According to his sensitivity test he is sensitive to kanamycin , ethide .pas and cla rithromycin we are giving these medicine along with pza and ethambutal after six months kanamycin was stoped.  But he is not cured still his culture is positive. Please doc. suggest how he will be negative which medicine should be added to his regiment and how long he should take the kanamycin injection. Doctor: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Persistent positive culture even after taking MDR (MultiDrug Resistance) TB treatment is suggestive of possible XDR (extremely drug resistance) TB or TDR (total drug resistance) TB.So better to get done sputum culture and sensitivity for XDR TB.He might need capriomycin injection, moxifloxacin, high dose INH, rifabutin, cycloserine, moxifloxacin etc.No need to give kanamycin injection now. First rule out XDR TB.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son.

Doctor: Hello and Welcome to \u2018Ask A Doctor\u2019 service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.I think you can conceive naturally also. Get a thyroid profile and prolactin level done. You can track your ovulation by repeated ultrasound and when follicle is more than 17 to 18 mm, take an injection for the rupture of follicles. Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop. Take progesterone for next 2 weeks after rupture is confirmed on ultrasound. Do a urine pregnancy test after that. You can try like that for 3 to 6 cycles. If it doesn't work, you can go for IUI.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Khushboo Priya"

I have an amh of 5, 10 dominant follicles, no blocked tubes or any apparent reasons for having had 2 miscarriages and a complete molar pregnancy all in 2 years: I have a 13 year old from a previous relationship. My husband has been checked and he s fine. My doctor had me on letrozole, progesterone for the end of my cycle and just prescribed prognova because lining is 7mm. We have been trying to conceive for 7 months. She has recommended ivf but we can not afford it. Is there anything else we can do or do I have any hope of conceiving naturally? Doctor: Hello and Welcome to \u2018Ask A Doctor\u2019 service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.I think you can conceive naturally also. Get a thyroid profile and prolactin level done. You can track your ovulation by repeated ultrasound and when follicle is more than 17 to 18 mm, take an injection for the rupture of follicles. Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop. Take progesterone for next 2 weeks after rupture is confirmed on ultrasound. Do a urine pregnancy test after that. You can try like that for 3 to 6 cycles. If it doesn't work, you can go for IUI.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Khushboo Priya\n</conversation>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nA 33-year-old with two miscarriages and a prior molar pregnancy, normal fertility workup, and limited funds asked about non-IVF options, and the doctor advised that natural conception is possible with thyroid/prolactin testing, monitored ovulation with a trigger shot, timed intercourse plus luteal progesterone for 3\u20136 cycles, and then consider IUI if not\n</response>\n\nThe reference response will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nSuggest treatment for infertility\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully review the <response> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nPlease evaluate the generated summary on a scale of 1-5 (1 = poor, 5 = excellent)\nfor each of these three key dimensions:\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the summary correctly capture the main medical issue and clinical details from the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the summary include all important medical information from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the summary easy to understand for clinical use?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput your evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Brief explanation of why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Brief explanation of why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Brief explanation of why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n"

This is the second round of medication that they have given to me. My bladder infection started over a month again.  Is there any reason for concern that my body is resistant to Cipro and that I have had a bladder infection for this long Doctor: Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.Your doctor intends to inform you that the bacteria causing your bladder infection are resistant to ciprofloxacin. Nowadays due to increased prescribing of antibiotics, the same strain of bacteria which would have been killed by an antibiotic let us say 10 years back, has developed genetic mutation and resistance such that they are able to grow even in the presence of the antibiotic.In other words, the bacteria are becoming more powerful and your antibiotics need to be changed. This is becoming an increasingly common problem in hospitals and you need not worry. The solution to your problem lies in changing over to sensitive antibiotics on your urine culture report. Some of the highly specific antibiotics for urinary infections include nitrofurantoin and newer cephalosoprins. This will be decided by your doctor and you must complete the course for quick recovery.Hope thishelps"

This is the second round of medication that they have given to me. My bladder infection started over a month again.  Is there any reason for concern that my body is resistant to Cipro and that I have had a bladder infection for this long Doctor: Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.Your doctor intends to inform you that the bacteria causing your bladder infection are resistant to ciprofloxacin. Nowadays due to increased prescribing of antibiotics, the same strain of bacteria which would have been killed by an antibiotic let us say 10 years back, has developed genetic mutation and resistance such that they are able to grow even in the presence of the antibiotic.In other words, the bacteria are becoming more powerful and your antibiotics need to be changed. This is becoming an increasingly common problem in hospitals and you need not worry. The solution to your problem lies in changing over to sensitive antibiotics on your urine culture report. Some of the highly specific antibiotics for urinary infections include nitrofurantoin and newer cephalosoprins. This will be decided by your doctor and you must complete the course for quick recovery.Hope thishelps\nSummary:",

Its better if you can send me the details like reports of echo and other. I think, in your case it's better not to chase for rhythm control strategy as it's unlikely to be successful in you. It's better to go for rate control strategy with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and Amiodarone if needed.   Hope I have answered your query.

Blood tests allow a doctor/physician to see a detailed analysis of any disease markers, the nutrients and waste products in your blood as well as how various organs (e.g., kidneys and liver) are functioning, so if examination or history doesn't reveal much about patient ailment thus laboratory tests are tools helpful in evaluating the health status of an individual3.  since the most common tests are done using a blood sample, or with use of portable machines thus search in your area where the rates are low.\n</conversation>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nA financially constrained patient avoids blood tests, and the doctor explains their benefits and limits for health assessment and suggests seeking affordable local testing options.\n</response>\n\nThe reference response will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nWhat is the home done test for blood level check ?\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully review the <response> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nPlease evaluate the generated summary on a scale of 1-5 (1 = poor, 5 = excellent)\nfor each of these three key dimensions:\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the summary correctly capture the main medical issue and clinical details from the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the summary include all important medical information from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the summary easy to understand for clinical use?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput your evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Brief explanation of why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Brief explanation of why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Brief explanation of why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n"
