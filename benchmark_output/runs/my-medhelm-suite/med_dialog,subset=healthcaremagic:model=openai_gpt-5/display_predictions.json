So if the animal did have rabies could I have rabies now? Doctor: Hello thanx to contact healthcare magic. If I am your suggestion giving Doctor I suggest you that you should not be worry regarding rabies. Rabies only spreads through damaged nerves, which happens in the case of biting by dogs. But it wont spread by biting of nails. But if suppose when you biting the nail you got injured the fingerbed you might be infected with rabies. But I think you have not injured your finger during biting the nail so do not worry regarding that.

Do you have fever/ watery diarrhea/ constipation/ spasmodic abdominal pain/ nausea or vomiting/ weight loss/ mucus discharge in stools?  Do you have any mass palpable in abdomen? Is there any aggravating or relieving factor for abdominal pain? With the available described symptoms, there could b possibility of peritonitis or muscular ache. You should consult with internal medicine specialist/ gastroenterologist and should go for thorough check up. You should go for complete blood count, urine routine microscopy, renal function test, serum amylase and lipase, colonoscopy, UGI endoscopy for better clarification. You should take low fat, spicy soft diet. Meanwhile, you should take antispasmodics along with proton pump inhibitors. Treatment depends on exact diagnosis.

Doctor: Hello and Welcome to \u2018Ask A Doctor\u2019 service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.I think you can conceive naturally also. Get a thyroid profile and prolactin level done. You can track your ovulation by repeated ultrasound and when follicle is more than 17 to 18 mm, take an injection for the rupture of follicles. Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop. Take progesterone for next 2 weeks after rupture is confirmed on ultrasound. Do a urine pregnancy test after that. You can try like that for 3 to 6 cycles. If it doesn't work, you can go for IUI.Hope I have answered your query.

Nowadays due to increased prescribing of antibiotics, the same strain of bacteria which would have been killed by an antibiotic let us say 10 years back, has developed genetic mutation and resistance such that they are able to grow even in the presence of the antibiotic.In other words, the bacteria are becoming more powerful and your antibiotics need to be changed. This is becoming an increasingly common problem in hospitals and you need not worry. The solution to your problem lies in changing over to sensitive antibiotics on your urine culture report.

Will it continue to grow if not treated? If he has the NFi gene, can it be treated with meds? If not what kind of treatment is available. The mass in his abdomen also shows it s wrapped around major arteries! What now? Doctor: hi,Thanks for writing in.Plexiform neurofibromas in strategic locations are to be removed through skilled surgery. It is important to know the size and extension of the tumor and if there are any cancerous areas which are developing within. In that case,  you must consult an oncosurgeon and vascular surgeon and know the implications of the tumor causing pressure effects or the rare possibility of the tumor infiltrating the arteries. Medicines are not a treatment option for these tumors. Though the tumors are usually benign and harmless, increase in size with time and malignant transformation cannot be entirely ruled out in your grandson. That might take years to happen but it can be easily prevented by getting treated through surgery at present.\n</conversation>\n\nThe response will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nThe doctor advises that abdominal plexiform neurofibromas should be evaluated for size, extension, malignancy, and arterial involvement and are best treated with skilled surgical removal (no effective medications), with referral to an oncosurgeon and vascular surgeon, since they are usually benign but can grow and rarely become malignant.\n</response>\n\nThe reference response will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nSuggest treatment for plexiform neurofibroma in abdomen\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully review the <response> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nPlease evaluate the generated summary on a scale of 1-5 (1 = poor, 5 = excellent)\nfor each of these three key dimensions:\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the summary correctly capture the main medical issue and clinical details from the conversation?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\n- Does the summary include all important medical information from the conversation?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the summary easy to understand for clinical use?\n\nOutput Format:\nOutput your evaluation as a single valid JSON object matching the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Brief explanation of why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Brief explanation of why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Brief explanation of why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n"
