I may have ran over something and when I came inside after cleaning it I forgot to wash my hands and began playing a video game then I realized I needed to wash my hands so I did then I came back and forgot to clean my mouse and I have a bad habit of biting my nails. So if the animal did have rabies could I have rabies now? Doctor: Hello thanx to contact healthcare magic. If I am your suggestion giving Doctor I suggest you that you should not be worry regarding rabies. Rabies only spreads through damaged nerves, which happens in the case of biting by dogs. But it wont spread by biting of nails. But if suppose when you biting the nail you got injured the fingerbed you might be infected with rabies. But I think you have not injured your finger during biting the nail so do not worry regarding that. If you have anything else to ask kindly contact me Dr Arun Tank, Infectious Disease specialist.\nSummary:",

Do you have fever/ watery diarrhea/ constipation/ spasmodic abdominal pain/ nausea or vomiting/ weight loss/ mucus discharge in stools?  Do you have any mass palpable in abdomen? Is there any aggravating or relieving factor for abdominal pain? With the available described symptoms, there could b possibility of peritonitis or muscular ache. You should consult with internal medicine specialist/ gastroenterologist and should go for thorough check up. You should go for complete blood count, urine routine microscopy, renal function test, serum amylase and lipase, colonoscopy, UGI endoscopy for better clarification. You should take low fat, spicy soft diet. Meanwhile, you should take antispasmodics along with proton pump inhibitors. Treatment depends on exact diagnosis. Take care, Dr. Mayank Bhargava\nSummary:",

According to his sensitivity test he is sensitive to kanamycin , ethide .pas and cla rithromycin we are giving these medicine along with pza and ethambutal after six months kanamycin was stoped.  But he is not cured still his culture is positive. Please doc. suggest how he will be negative which medicine should be added to his regiment and how long he should take the kanamycin injection. Doctor: Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Persistent positive culture even after taking MDR (MultiDrug Resistance) TB treatment is suggestive of possible XDR (extremely drug resistance) TB or TDR (total drug resistance) TB.So better to get done sputum culture and sensitivity for XDR TB.He might need capriomycin injection, moxifloxacin, high dose INH, rifabutin, cycloserine, moxifloxacin etc.No need to give kanamycin injection now. First rule out XDR TB.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks.\nSummary:",

We have been trying to conceive for 7 months. She has recommended ivf but we can not afford it. Is there anything else we can do or do I have any hope of conceiving naturally? Doctor: Hello and Welcome to \u2018Ask A Doctor\u2019 service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.I think you can conceive naturally also. Get a thyroid profile and prolactin level done. You can track your ovulation by repeated ultrasound and when follicle is more than 17 to 18 mm, take an injection for the rupture of follicles. Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop. Take progesterone for next 2 weeks after rupture is confirmed on ultrasound. Do a urine pregnancy test after that. You can try like that for 3 to 6 cycles. If it doesn't work, you can go for IUI.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Khushboo Priya\nSummary:",

This is the second round of medication that they have given to me. My bladder infection started over a month again.  Is there any reason for concern that my body is resistant to Cipro and that I have had a bladder infection for this long Doctor: Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.Your doctor intends to inform you that the bacteria causing your bladder infection are resistant to ciprofloxacin. Nowadays due to increased prescribing of antibiotics, the same strain of bacteria which would have been killed by an antibiotic let us say 10 years back, has developed genetic mutation and resistance such that they are able to grow even in the presence of the antibiotic.In other words, the bacteria are becoming more powerful and your antibiotics need to be changed. This is becoming an increasingly common problem in hospitals and you need not worry. The solution to your problem lies in changing over to sensitive antibiotics on your urine culture report. Some of the highly specific antibiotics for urinary infections include nitrofurantoin and newer cephalosoprins. This will be decided by your doctor and you must complete the course for quick recovery.Hope thishelps\nSummary:",

Doctor: **1. since blood tests require specific reagent to show whether the levels of different substances in your blood fall within a normal range, thus they can help you and your doctor learn more about your health and can help find potential problems early, when treatments or lifestyle changes may work best, but blood tests alone cannot be used to diagnose certain medical problems.2. Blood tests allow a doctor/physician to see a detailed analysis of any disease markers, the nutrients and waste products in your blood as well as how various organs (e.g., kidneys and liver) are functioning, so if examination or history doesn't reveal much about patient ailment thus laboratory tests are tools helpful in evaluating the health status of an individual3.  since the most common tests are done using a blood sample, or with use of portable machines thus search in your area where the rates are low.\nSummary:",

Doctor: hi,Thanks for writing in.Plexiform neurofibromas in strategic locations are to be removed through skilled surgery. It is important to know the size and extension of the tumor and if there are any cancerous areas which are developing within. In that case,  you must consult an oncosurgeon and vascular surgeon and know the implications of the tumor causing pressure effects or the rare possibility of the tumor infiltrating the arteries. Medicines are not a treatment option for these tumors. Though the tumors are usually benign and harmless, increase in size with time and malignant transformation cannot be entirely ruled out in your grandson. That might take years to happen but it can be easily prevented by getting treated through surgery at present.\nSummary:",
