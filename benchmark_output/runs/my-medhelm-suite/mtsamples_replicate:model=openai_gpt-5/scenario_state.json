The patient states that he was working in his garage over the past few days when he noticed some redness and edema in his right foot. He notes some itching as well as increasing pain and redness in the right foot and presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room. He was evaluated by the Emergency Room staff as well as the medical team and the Department of Orthopedics. It was noted upon x-ray a foreign body in his foot and he had significant amount of cellulitis as well ________ right lower extremity. After a long discussion held with the patient, it was elected to proceed with irrigation debridement and removal of the foreign body.PROCEDURE:  After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained. The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, operative surgeon, the Department of Anesthesia and nursing staff. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #5 and placed on the operating table in supine position. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. The Department of Anesthesia was administered spinal anesthetic to the patient. Once this anesthesia was obtained, the patient's right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Upon viewing of the plantar aspect of the foot, there was noted to be a swollen ecchymotic area with a small hole in it, which purulent fluid was coming from. At this time, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified as well as the localization of the pus, a 2 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this area, which was located between the second and third metatarsal heads. Upon incising this, there was a foul smelling purulent fluid, which flowed from this region. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken as well as gram stain. The area was explored and it ________ to the dorsum of the foot. There was no obvious joint involvement. After all loculations were broken, 3 liters antibiotic-impregnated fluid were pulse-evac through the wound. The wound was again inspected with no more gross purulent or necrotic appearing tissue. The wound was then packed with an iodoform gauge and a sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, floss, and Kerlix covered by an Ace bandage. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to Postanesthesia Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.DISPOSITION: The patient will be followed on a daily basis for possible repeat irrigation debridement.\nKeywords:\u00a0orthopedic, removal of foreign body, purulent material, metatarsal, cellulitis, abscess, kerlix, foreign body, foot, irrigation, debridement, purulent,"

Daily ortho/ID rounds; low threshold for repeat irrigation and debridement if persistent purulence, necrosis, or systemic signs.\n- Empiric IV antibiotics (adjust for renal function and de-escalate to culture results):\n  - Cover MRSA, gram-negatives (including Pseudomonas if puncture through shoe is suspected), and anaerobes:\n    - Preferred: vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam.\n    - Alternatives: vancomycin + cefepime + metronidazole; or for severe beta-lactam allergy: vancomycin + aztreonam + metronidazole.\n  - Duration: typically 10\u201314 days for soft-tissue infection after source control; extend to 2\u20133 weeks if slow response. Transition to active oral agents once improving and able to tolerate PO.\n- Culture-directed step-down (examples; tailor to MICs and allergies):\n  - MSSA/streptococci: cefazolin IV \u2192 cephalexin or amoxicillin-clavulanate PO.\n  - MRSA: vancomycin IV \u2192 doxycycline, TMP-SMX, clindamycin (if D-test negative), or linezolid PO.\n  - Gram-negatives/anaerobes: ampicillin-sulbactam IV \u2192 amoxicillin-clavulanate PO; or levofloxacin + metronidazole if beta-lactam allergy.\n- Tetanus prophylaxis: give Tdap if not up to date; add TIG if immunization unknown/incomplete and wound is tetanus-prone.\n- Pain: acetaminophen on schedule; short-course opioid PRN. Avoid/limit NSAIDs if renal risk.\n- DVT prophylaxis: enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily (or mechanical if contraindicated).\n\nWound management\n- Maintain current iodoform gauze packing; sterile dressing changes at least daily (more often if saturated). Elevate foot to reduce edema.\n- Inspect for ongoing drainage, malodor, crepitus, expanding erythema, or necrosis. If present, return to OR for repeat I&D.\n- Consider negative-pressure wound",

The patient states that he was working in his garage over the past few days when he noticed some redness and edema in his right foot. He notes some itching as well as increasing pain and redness in the right foot and presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room. He was evaluated by the Emergency Room staff as well as the medical team and the Department of Orthopedics. It was noted upon x-ray a foreign body in his foot and he had significant amount of cellulitis as well ________ right lower extremity. After a long discussion held with the patient, it was elected to proceed with irrigation debridement and removal of the foreign body.PROCEDURE:  After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained. The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, operative surgeon, the Department of Anesthesia and nursing staff. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #5 and placed on the operating table in supine position. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. The Department of Anesthesia was administered spinal anesthetic to the patient. Once this anesthesia was obtained, the patient's right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Upon viewing of the plantar aspect of the foot, there was noted to be a swollen ecchymotic area with a small hole in it, which purulent fluid was coming from. At this time, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified as well as the localization of the pus, a 2 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this area, which was located between the second and third metatarsal heads. Upon incising this, there was a foul smelling purulent fluid, which flowed from this region. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken as well as gram stain. The area was explored and it ________ to the dorsum of the foot. There was no obvious joint involvement. After all loculations were broken, 3 liters antibiotic-impregnated fluid were pulse-evac through the wound. The wound was again inspected with no more gross purulent or necrotic appearing tissue. The wound was then packed with an iodoform gauge and a sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, floss, and Kerlix covered by an Ace bandage. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to Postanesthesia Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.DISPOSITION: The patient will be followed on a daily basis for possible repeat irrigation debridement.\nKeywords:\u00a0orthopedic, removal of foreign body, purulent material, metatarsal, cellulitis, abscess, kerlix, foreign body, foot, irrigation, debridement, purulent,\n</patient_information>\n\nThe proposed treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nTreatment Plan: Cellulitis/Abscess with Foreign Body, Right Foot (Diabetic Patient)\n\nImmediate postoperative/inpatient care\n- Admit for IV antibiotics, glycemic control, wound care, and monitoring.

A six hole one-third tibial plate, one 12 mm 3.5 mm cortical screw fully threaded and two 16 mm 3.5 mm cortical fully-threaded screws. There were two 20 mm 4.0 cancellous screws and one 18 mm 4.0 cancellous screw placed. There were two 4.0 cancellous partially-threaded screws placed.\nGROSS FINDINGS: Include a comminuted fracture involving the lateral malleolus as well as a medial and posterior malleolus fracture as well.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 87-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room complaining of right ankle pain status post a trip and fall. The patient noted while walking with a walker, apparently tripped and fell. The patient had significant comorbidities, seen and evaluated by the Emergency Room Department as well as Department of Orthopedics while in the Emergency Room. At that time, a closed reduction was performed and she was placed in a Robert-Jones splint. After complete medical workup and clearance, we elected to take her to the operating room for definitive care.PROCEDURE: After all potential complications and risks as well as risks and benefits of the above-mentioned procedure was discussed at length with the patient and family, informed consent was obtained. The upper extremity was then confirmed with the operating surgeon, the patient, the nursing staff and Department of Anesthesia. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area in the Operative Suite #3 and placed on the operating room table in supine position. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic to the patient as well as sedation. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the right upper thigh of the patient. This was then removed and the right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The right lower extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using Esmarch and tourniquet was then placed to 325 mmHg and kept up to a total of 75 minutes. Next, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this vestibule on the right ankle. A sharp dissection was carefully taken down to the level of bone taking care to protect the neurovascular structures. Once the bone was reached, the fractured site was identified. The bony ends were then opened and divided of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum within the fracture site. The wound was copiously irrigated and dried. Next, the fracture was then reduced in anatomic position. There was noted to be quite a bit of comminution as well as soft overall status of the bone. It was held in place with reduction forceps. A six hole one-third tubular Synthes plate was then selected for instrumentation. It was contoured using ________ and placed on the lateral aspect of the distal fibula. Next, the three most proximal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged and then a 3.5 mm fully threaded cortical screw was placed in each. The most proximal was a 12 mm and the next two were 16 mm in length. Next, the three most distal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged, and a 4.0 cancellous screw was placed in each hole. The most distal with a 20 mm and two most proximal were 18 mm in length. Next the Xi-scan was used to visualize the hardware placement as well as the fracture reduction appeared to be in good anatomic position, all hardware was in good position. There was no lateralization of the joints. Attention was then directed towards the medial aspect of the ankle. Again, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 4 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over the medial malleolus. Again, the dissection was carefully taken down the level of the fracture site. The retractors were then placed to protect all neurovascular structures. Once the fracture site was identified, it was dried of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum. The fracture site was then displaced and the ankle joint was visualized including the dome of the talus. There appeared to be some minor degenerative changes of the talus, but no loose bodies. Next, the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The medial malleolus was placed in reduced position and held in place with a 1.25 mm K-wire. Next, the 2.5 mm drill bed was then used to sequentially drill holes to full depth and 4.0 cancellous screws were placed in each, each with a 45 mm in length. These appeared to hold the fracture site securely in an anatomic position. Again, Xi-scan was brought in to confirm placement of the screws. They were in good overall position and there was no lateralization of the joint. At this time, each wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The wounds were then closed using #2-0 Vicryl suture in subcutaneous fashion followed by staples on the skin. A sterile dressing was applied consistent with Adaptic, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Webril. A Robert-Jones style splint was then placed on the right lower extremity. This was covered by a 4-inch Depuy dressing. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney and to the Postanesthetic Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.\nKeywords:\u00a0orthopedic, ankle fracture, dislocation, open reduction, internal fixation, orif, trimalleolar ankle fracture, cortical screw, cancellous screws, fracture site, fracture, ankle, malleolus,"

After complete medical workup and clearance, we elected to take her to the operating room for definitive care.PROCEDURE: After all potential complications and risks as well as risks and benefits of the above-mentioned procedure was discussed at length with the patient and family, informed consent was obtained. The upper extremity was then confirmed with the operating surgeon, the patient, the nursing staff and Department of Anesthesia. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area in the Operative Suite #3 and placed on the operating room table in supine position. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic to the patient as well as sedation. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the right upper thigh of the patient. This was then removed and the right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The right lower extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using Esmarch and tourniquet was then placed to 325 mmHg and kept up to a total of 75 minutes. Next, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this vestibule on the right ankle. A sharp dissection was carefully taken down to the level of bone taking care to protect the neurovascular structures. Once the bone was reached, the fractured site was identified. The bony ends were then opened and divided of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum within the fracture site. The wound was copiously irrigated and dried. Next, the fracture was then reduced in anatomic position. There was noted to be quite a bit of comminution as well as soft overall status of the bone. It was held in place with reduction forceps. A six hole one-third tubular Synthes plate was then selected for instrumentation. It was contoured using ________ and placed on the lateral aspect of the distal fibula. Next, the three most proximal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged and then a 3.5 mm fully threaded cortical screw was placed in each. The most proximal was a 12 mm and the next two were 16 mm in length. Next, the three most distal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged, and a 4.0 cancellous screw was placed in each hole. The most distal with a 20 mm and two most proximal were 18 mm in length. Next the Xi-scan was used to visualize the hardware placement as well as the fracture reduction appeared to be in good anatomic position, all hardware was in good position. There was no lateralization of the joints. Attention was then directed towards the medial aspect of the ankle. Again, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 4 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over the medial malleolus. Again, the dissection was carefully taken down the level of the fracture site. The retractors were then placed to protect all neurovascular structures. Once the fracture site was identified, it was dried of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum. The fracture site was then displaced and the ankle joint was visualized including the dome of the talus. There appeared to be some minor degenerative changes of the talus, but no loose bodies. Next, the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The medial malleolus was placed in reduced position and held in place with a 1.25 mm K-wire. Next, the 2.5 mm drill bed was then used to sequentially drill holes to full depth and 4.0 cancellous screws were placed in each, each with a 45 mm in length. These appeared to hold the fracture site securely in an anatomic position. Again, Xi-scan was brought in to confirm placement of the screws. They were in good overall position and there was no lateralization of the joint. At this time, each wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The wounds were then closed using #2-0 Vicryl suture in subcutaneous fashion followed by staples on the skin. A sterile dressing was applied consistent with Adaptic, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Webril. A Robert-Jones style splint was then placed on the right lower extremity. This was covered by a 4-inch Depuy dressing. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney and to the Postanesthetic Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.\nKeywords:\u00a0orthopedic, ankle fracture, dislocation, open reduction, internal fixation, orif, trimalleolar ankle fracture, cortical screw, cancellous screws, fracture site, fracture, ankle, malleolus,\nAnswer:",

Dislocation right ankle.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Trimalleolar ankle fracture.2. Dislocation right ankle.PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Closed open reduction and internal fixation of right ankle.\nANESTHESIA: Spinal with sedation.COMPLICATIONS: None.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal.TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: 75 minutes at 325 mmHg.COMPONENTS:  Synthes small fragment set was used including a 2.5 mm drill bed. A six hole one-third tibial plate, one 12 mm 3.5 mm cortical screw fully threaded and two 16 mm 3.5 mm cortical fully-threaded screws. There were two 20 mm 4.0 cancellous screws and one 18 mm 4.0 cancellous screw placed. There were two 4.0 cancellous partially-threaded screws placed.\nGROSS FINDINGS: Include a comminuted fracture involving the lateral malleolus as well as a medial and posterior malleolus fracture as well.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 87-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room complaining of right ankle pain status post a trip and fall. The patient noted while walking with a walker, apparently tripped and fell. The patient had significant comorbidities, seen and evaluated by the Emergency Room Department as well as Department of Orthopedics while in the Emergency Room. At that time, a closed reduction was performed and she was placed in a Robert-Jones splint. After complete medical workup and clearance, we elected to take her to the operating room for definitive care.PROCEDURE: After all potential complications and risks as well as risks and benefits of the above-mentioned procedure was discussed at length with the patient and family, informed consent was obtained. The upper extremity was then confirmed with the operating surgeon, the patient, the nursing staff and Department of Anesthesia. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area in the Operative Suite #3 and placed on the operating room table in supine position. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic to the patient as well as sedation. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the right upper thigh of the patient. This was then removed and the right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The right lower extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using Esmarch and tourniquet was then placed to 325 mmHg and kept up to a total of 75 minutes. Next, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this vestibule on the right ankle. A sharp dissection was carefully taken down to the level of bone taking care to protect the neurovascular structures. Once the bone was reached, the fractured site was identified. The bony ends were then opened and divided of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum within the fracture site. The wound was copiously irrigated and dried. Next, the fracture was then reduced in anatomic position. There was noted to be quite a bit of comminution as well as soft overall status of the bone. It was held in place with reduction forceps. A six hole one-third tubular Synthes plate was then selected for instrumentation. It was contoured using ________ and placed on the lateral aspect of the distal fibula. Next, the three most proximal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged and then a 3.5 mm fully threaded cortical screw was placed in each. The most proximal was a 12 mm and the next two were 16 mm in length. Next, the three most distal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged, and a 4.0 cancellous screw was placed in each hole. The most distal with a 20 mm and two most proximal were 18 mm in length. Next the Xi-scan was used to visualize the hardware placement as well as the fracture reduction appeared to be in good anatomic position, all hardware was in good position. There was no lateralization of the joints. Attention was then directed towards the medial aspect of the ankle. Again, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 4 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over the medial malleolus. Again, the dissection was carefully taken down the level of the fracture site. The retractors were then placed to protect all neurovascular structures. Once the fracture site was identified, it was dried of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum. The fracture site was then displaced and the ankle joint was visualized including the dome of the talus. There appeared to be some minor degenerative changes of the talus, but no loose bodies. Next, the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The medial malleolus was placed in reduced position and held in place with a 1.25 mm K-wire. Next, the 2.5 mm drill bed was then used to sequentially drill holes to full depth and 4.0 cancellous screws were placed in each, each with a 45 mm in length. These appeared to hold the fracture site securely in an anatomic position. Again, Xi-scan was brought in to confirm placement of the screws. They were in good overall position and there was no lateralization of the joint. At this time, each wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The wounds were then closed using #2-0 Vicryl suture in subcutaneous fashion followed by staples on the skin. A sterile dressing was applied consistent with Adaptic, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Webril. A Robert-Jones style splint was then placed on the right lower extremity. This was covered by a 4-inch Depuy dressing. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney and to the Postanesthetic Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.\nKeywords:\u00a0orthopedic, ankle fracture, dislocation, open reduction, internal fixation, orif, trimalleolar ankle fracture, cortical screw, cancellous screws, fracture site, fracture, ankle, malleolus,\n</patient_information>\n\nThe proposed treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nOrthopedic treatment plan: Trimalleolar ankle fracture\u2013dislocation, status post ORIF (right)\n\nSummary\n- 87-year-old woman s/p open reduction and internal fixation of a comminuted trimalleolar fracture\u2013dislocation of the right ankle with lateral plate/screws and medial malleolar screws.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 59-year-old with a BRCA-2 mutation. Her sister died of breast cancer at age 32 and her daughter had breast cancer at age 27.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The chest was clear. The abdomen was nontender. Pelvic examination shows no masses. No heart murmur. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent surgery on the day of admission. In the postoperative course she was afebrile and unremarkable. The patient regained bowel function and was discharged on the morning of the fourth postoperative day.OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES:  Total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with resection of ovarian fossa peritoneum en bloc on July 25, 2006.\nPATHOLOGY:  A 105-gram uterus without dysplasia or cancer.CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.\n</patient_information>\n\nThe proposed treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nAssessment\n- 59-year-old woman with a pathogenic BRCA2 mutation and strong family history of early-onset breast cancer.\n- Status post risk-reducing total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH-BSO); pathology benign; no adjuvant therapy indicated.\n- Main ongoing needs: postoperative recovery, breast cancer risk management, counseling on residual cancer risks, bone health and menopausal symptom management, and family cascade testing.\n\nPlan\n\n1) Postoperative care (now through 6 weeks)\n- Activity: Walk daily; avoid heavy lifting >10\u201315 lb, core-straining activity, and vaginal intercourse/tampons/douching for 6 weeks.\n- Incision care: Keep clean/dry; no soaking until cleared. Watch for redness, discharge, fever >100.4 F, worsening pain, wound opening.\n- Pain/bowel: Acetaminophen \u00b1 NSAID if no contraindications; short course of opioid only if needed. Daily stool softener (docusate) \u00b1 senna; hydrate, high-fiber diet.\n- VTE prevention: Early ambulation; consider 7\u201310 days of prophylactic LMWH if additional risk factors (prior VTE, obesity, limited mobility), otherwise not routinely needed after discharge.\n- Follow-up: Gynecologic oncology/gynecology visit in 2 weeks and again around 6 weeks to assess healing and review final pathology.\n\n2) Breast cancer risk management (BRCA2)\n- High-risk breast clinic referral and genetic counseling.\n- Imaging surveillance (if no risk-reducing mastectomy):\n  - Clinical breast exam every 6\u201312 months.\n  - Annual breast MRI with contrast and annual digital mammogram; stagger studies every 6 months (e.g., MRI at month 0, mammogram at month 6).\n- Risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy:\n  - Discuss with breast surgeon; reduces breast cancer risk by ~90\u201395%. Include reconstruction options and psychosocial considerations.\n- Chemoprevention (if choosing surveillance rather than mastectomy):\n  - Discuss benefits/risks of tamoxifen 20 mg daily x 5 years (endometrial cancer risk is not a concern post-hysterectomy; monitor for VTE, hot flashes).\n  - For postmenopausal women, alternatives include raloxifene 60 mg daily or aromatase inhibitors (e.g., exemestane), considering\n</response>\n\nThe gold standard treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nThe patient will remain at rest initially with progressive ambulation after.

He has a past history of known hyperthyroidism since 1992 and a more recent history of atrial fibrillation and congestive cardiac failure with an ejection fraction of 20%-25%. The main cause for his shortness of breath was believed to be due to atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism in a setting with congestive cardiac failure. During his hospital stay, he was commenced on metoprolol for rate control, and given that he had atrial fibrillation, he was also started on warfarin, which his INR has been followed up by the Homeless Clinic. For his congestive cardiac failure, he was restarted on Digoxin and lisinopril. For his hyperthyroidism, we restarted him on PTU and the endocrinologists were happy to review him when he was euthymic to discuss further radioiodine or radiotherapy. He was restarted on PTU and discharged from the hospital on this medication. While in the hospital, it was also noted that he abused cigarettes and cocaine, and we advised strongly against this given the condition of his heart. It was also noted that he had elevated liver function tests, which an ultrasound was normal, but his hepatitis panel was pending. Since his discharge, his hepatitis panel has come back normal for hepatitis A, B, and C. Since discharge, the patient has complained of shortness of breath, mainly at night when lying flat, but otherwise he states he has been well and compliant with his medication.MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 5 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg twice daily, PTU (propylthiouracil) 300 mg orally four times a day, warfarin variable dose based on INR.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: He was afebrile today. Blood pressure 114/98. Pulse 92 but irregular. Respiratory rate 25.HEENT: Obvious exophthalmus, but no obvious lid lag today.NECK: There was no thyroid mass palpable.CHEST: Clear except for occasional bibasilar crackles.CARDIOVASCULAR: Heart sounds were dual, but irregular, with no additional sounds.\nABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended.EXTREMITIES: Mild +1 peripheral edema in both legs."

              "text": "The patient has also been attending the Homeless Clinic since discharge from the hospital, where he has been receiving quality care and they have been looking after every aspect of his health, including his hyperthyroidism. It is our recommendation that a TSH and T4 be continually checked until the patient is euthymic, at which time he should attend endocrine review with Dr. Huffman for further treatment of his hyperthyroidism. Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he is moderately rate controlled with metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. His rate in clinic today was 92. He could benefit from increasing his metoprolol dose, however, in the hospital it was noted that he was bradycardic in the morning with a pulse rate down to the 50s, and we were concerned with making this patient bradycardic in the setting of congestive cardiac failure. Regarding his congestive cardiac failure, he currently appears stable, with some variation in his weight. He states he has been taking his wife's Lasix tablets for diuretic benefit when he feels weight gain coming on and increased edema. We should consider adding him on a low-dose furosemide tablet to be taken either daily or when his weight is above his target range. A Digoxin level has not been repeated since discharge, and we feel that this should be followed up. We have also increased his lisinopril to 5 mg daily, but the patient did not receive his script upon departing our clinic. Regarding his elevated liver function tests, we feel that these are very likely secondary to hepatic congestion secondary to congestive cardiac failure with a normal ultrasound and normal hepatitis panel, but yet the liver function tests should be followed up."

Recently started on metoprolol, warfarin, lisinopril, digoxin, and high-dose PTU; history of elevated LFTs; hepatitis panel negative. Active tobacco and prior cocaine use.\n\nTreatment plan:\n\n1) Congestive heart failure (HFrEF, volume overload)\n- Start loop diuretic for decongestion: furosemide 20\u201340 mg PO daily, titrate to relieve orthopnea/edema; goal net weight loss 1\u20132 lb/day. Check BMP in 3\u20137 days (Na, K, Cr).\n- Continue ACE inhibitor (lisinopril 5 mg daily); uptitrate every 1\u20132 weeks as tolerated toward 20\u201340 mg daily; hold uptitration if SBP <95, K+ >5.0, or Cr rises >30%.\n- Use an evidence-based beta-blocker for HFrEF and AF rate control: switch to metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily (or carvedilol 3.125\u20136.25 mg BID if blood pressure allows and cocaine abstinence is maintained); uptitrate every 2 weeks as tolerated to target dose.\n- Add mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist: spironolactone 12.5\u201325 mg daily if K+ \u22645.0 and eGFR \u226530; recheck K+/Cr in 3\u20137 days, then at 2 and 4 weeks.\n- Consider SGLT2 inhibitor (e.g., dapagliflozin 10 mg daily) if eGFR \u226530 and no contraindications.\n- Continue digoxin but check level and renal function within a week; target level 0.5\u20130.9 ng/mL. Consider decreasing to 0.125 mg daily once euvolemic and euthyroid.\n- Lifestyle: sodium \u22642 g/day, fluid ~2 L/day if congested, daily weights, call if weight up >2 lb/day or 5 lb/week. Elevate head of bed until diuresed.\n- Reassess EF after 3 months of optimized therapy and euthyroid state; consider",

He has a past history of known hyperthyroidism since 1992 and a more recent history of atrial fibrillation and congestive cardiac failure with an ejection fraction of 20%-25%. The main cause for his shortness of breath was believed to be due to atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism in a setting with congestive cardiac failure. During his hospital stay, he was commenced on metoprolol for rate control, and given that he had atrial fibrillation, he was also started on warfarin, which his INR has been followed up by the Homeless Clinic. For his congestive cardiac failure, he was restarted on Digoxin and lisinopril. For his hyperthyroidism, we restarted him on PTU and the endocrinologists were happy to review him when he was euthymic to discuss further radioiodine or radiotherapy. He was restarted on PTU and discharged from the hospital on this medication. While in the hospital, it was also noted that he abused cigarettes and cocaine, and we advised strongly against this given the condition of his heart. It was also noted that he had elevated liver function tests, which an ultrasound was normal, but his hepatitis panel was pending. Since his discharge, his hepatitis panel has come back normal for hepatitis A, B, and C. Since discharge, the patient has complained of shortness of breath, mainly at night when lying flat, but otherwise he states he has been well and compliant with his medication.MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 5 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg twice daily, PTU (propylthiouracil) 300 mg orally four times a day, warfarin variable dose based on INR.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: He was afebrile today. Blood pressure 114/98. Pulse 92 but irregular. Respiratory rate 25.HEENT: Obvious exophthalmus, but no obvious lid lag today.NECK: There was no thyroid mass palpable.CHEST: Clear except for occasional bibasilar crackles.CARDIOVASCULAR: Heart sounds were dual, but irregular, with no additional sounds.\nABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended.EXTREMITIES: Mild +1 peripheral edema in both legs.\n</patient_information>\n\nThe proposed treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nAssessment summary:\n- 43-year-old man with Graves hyperthyroidism (exophthalmos), persistent atrial fibrillation, and HFrEF (EF 20\u201325%) now with orthopnea, bibasilar crackles, and +1 edema. Recently started on metoprolol, warfarin, lisinopril, digoxin, and high-dose PTU; history of elevated LFTs; hepatitis panel negative. Active tobacco and prior cocaine use.\n\nTreatment plan:\n\n1) Congestive heart failure (HFrEF, volume overload)\n- Start loop diuretic for decongestion: furosemide 20\u201340 mg PO daily, titrate to relieve orthopnea/edema; goal net weight loss 1\u20132 lb/day. Check BMP in 3\u20137 days (Na, K, Cr).\n- Continue ACE inhibitor (lisinopril 5 mg daily); uptitrate every 1\u20132 weeks as tolerated toward 20\u201340 mg daily; hold uptitration if SBP <95, K+ >5.0, or Cr rises >30%.\n- Use an evidence-based beta-blocker for HFrEF and AF rate control: switch to metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily (or carvedilol 3.125\u20136.25 mg BID if blood pressure allows and cocaine abstinence is maintained); uptitrate every 2 weeks as tolerated to target dose.\n- Add mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist: spironolactone 12.5\u201325 mg daily if K+ \u22645.0 and eGFR \u226530; recheck K+/Cr in 3\u20137 days, then at 2 and 4 weeks.\n- Consider SGLT2 inhibitor (e.g., dapagliflozin 10 mg daily) if eGFR \u226530 and no contraindications.\n- Continue digoxin but check level and renal function within a week; target level 0.5\u20130.9 ng/mL. Consider decreasing to 0.125 mg daily once euvolemic and euthyroid.\n- Lifestyle: sodium \u22642 g/day, fluid ~2 L/day if congested, daily weights, call if weight up >2 lb/day or 5 lb/week. Elevate head of bed until diuresed.\n- Reassess EF after 3 months of optimized therapy and euthyroid state; consider\n</response>\n\nThe gold standard treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nThe patient has also been attending the Homeless Clinic since discharge from the hospital, where he has been receiving quality care and they have been looking after every aspect of his health, including his hyperthyroidism. It is our recommendation that a TSH and T4 be continually checked until the patient is euthymic, at which time he should attend endocrine review with Dr. Huffman for further treatment of his hyperthyroidism. Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he is moderately rate controlled with metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. His rate in clinic today was 92. He could benefit from increasing his metoprolol dose, however, in the hospital it was noted that he was bradycardic in the morning with a pulse rate down to the 50s, and we were concerned with making this patient bradycardic in the setting of congestive cardiac failure. Regarding his congestive cardiac failure, he currently appears stable, with some variation in his weight. He states he has been taking his wife's Lasix tablets for diuretic benefit when he feels weight gain coming on and increased edema. We should consider adding him on a low-dose furosemide tablet to be taken either daily or when his weight is above his target range. A Digoxin level has not been repeated since discharge, and we feel that this should be followed up. We have also increased his lisinopril to 5 mg daily, but the patient did not receive his script upon departing our clinic. Regarding his elevated liver function tests, we feel that these are very likely secondary to hepatic congestion secondary to congestive cardiac failure with a normal ultrasound and normal hepatitis panel, but yet the liver function tests should be followed up.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <patient_information> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each category below, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent) and\nprovide a brief explanation for your score:\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the treatment plan provide correct medical advice based on clinical guidelines?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\nDoes the treatment plan include all important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the treatment plan written clearly so clinicians can easily understand it?\n\nOutput Format:\nGenerate a valid JSON object with the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n"

Acquired hypothyroidism.2. Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland, status post total thyroidectomy in 1992.3. Diabetes mellitus.4. Insomnia with sleep apnea.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a return visit to the endocrine clinic for the patient with history as noted above. She is 45 years old. Her last visit was about 6 months ago. Since that time, the patient states her health has remained unchanged. Currently, primary complaint is one of fatigue that she feels throughout the day. She states, however, she is doing well with CPAP and wakes up feeling refreshed but tends to tire out later in the day. In terms of her thyroid issues, the patient states that she is not having signs or symptoms of thyroid excess or hypothyroidism. She is not reporting temperature intolerance, palpitations, muscle weakness, tremors, nausea, vomiting, constipation, hyperdefecation or diarrhea. Her weight has been stable. She is not reporting proximal muscle weakness.CURRENT MEDICATIONS:1. Levothyroxine 125 micrograms p.o. once daily.\n2. CPAP.3. Glucotrol.4. Avandamet.5. Synthroid.6. Byetta injected twice daily.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As stated in the HPI. She is not reporting polyuria, polydipsia or polyphagia. She is not reporting fevers, chills, sweats, visual acuity changes, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea. She is not having any lightheadedness, weakness, chest pain, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, orthopnea or dyspnea on exertion.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: She is an overweight, very pleasant woman, in no acute distress. VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 96.9, pulse 85, respirations not counted, blood pressure 135/65, and weight 85.7 kg. NECK: Reveals well healed surgical scar in the anteroinferior aspect of the neck. There is no palpable thyroid tissue noted on this examination today. There is no lymphadenopathy. THORAX: Reveals lungs that are clear, PA and lateral, without adventitious sounds. CARDIOVASCULAR: Demonstrated regular rate and rhythm. S1 and S2 without murmur. No S3, no S4 is auscultated. EXTREMITIES: Deep tendon reflexes 2+/4 without a delayed relaxation phase. No fine resting tremor of the outstretched upper extremity. SKIN, HAIR, AND NAILS: All are unremarkable.\nLABORATORY DATABASE:  Lab data on 08/29/07 showed the following: Thyroglobulin quantitative less than 0.5 and thyroglobulin antibody less than 20, free T4 1.35, and TSH suppressed at 0.121.ASSESSMENT AND\n</patient_information>\n\nThe proposed treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nAssessment:\n1) Papillary thyroid carcinoma s/p total thyroidectomy (1992) with excellent response to therapy. Undetectable thyroglobulin, negative Tg antibodies, no clinical or exam evidence of recurrence.\n2) Postsurgical hypothyroidism with TSH suppressed to 0.121 on levothyroxine; free T4 normal; no hyperthyroid or hypothyroid symptoms.\n3) Type 2 diabetes mellitus on a complex regimen; current glycemic control unknown (no recent A1c provided); denies classic hyperglycemia symptoms.\n4) Obstructive sleep apnea with residual daytime fatigue despite CPAP; insomnia history.\n5) Overweight; cardiometabolic risk factors.\n\nPlan:\n1) Thyroid cancer surveillance and thyroid hormone replacement\n- Relax TSH suppression given long-term, low-risk disease status and undetectable Tg.\n- Adjust levothyroxine from 125 mcg daily to 112 mcg daily (or 125 mcg 6 days/week) and recheck TSH and free T4 in 6\u20138 weeks. Target TSH 0.5\u20132.0 mIU/L.\n- Clarify that \u201cSynthroid\u201d and \u201clevothyroxine\u201d are the same medication; continue only one prescription at the adjusted dose.\n- Administration counseling: take on an empty stomach with water, 30\u201360 minutes before breakfast; separate from calcium/iron by at least 4 hours.\n- Surveillance: check thyroglobulin and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies annually. Neck ultrasound only if Tg becomes detectable, antibodies rise, or exam changes.\n- Bone/cardiac risk from prior TSH suppression: ensure adequate calcium/vitamin D intake; consider baseline DEXA if not done within the past 2 years; monitor for palpitations/arrhythmias.\n\n2) Diabetes management\n- Obtain labs: A1c, fasting lipid panel, CMP (including eGFR), LFTs, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, vitamin B12 (on metformin), and blood pressure log.\n- Medications:\n  \u2022 Prefer metformin as foundation (if eGFR \u226545); consider switching Avandamet to metformin XR titrated to 2000 mg/day as tolerated and discontinue rosiglitazone due to adverse risk profile.\n  \u2022 Continue a GLP-1 receptor agonist for glycemic control and weight benefit; consider switching from\n</response>\n\nThe gold standard treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nThis is a 45-year-old woman with history as noted above.1. Acquired hypothyroidism, status post total thyroidectomy for papillary carcinoma in 1992.2. Plan to continue following thyroglobulin levels.3. Plan to obtain a free T4, TSH, and thyroglobulin levels today.4. Have the patient call the clinic next week for followup and continued management of her hypothyroid state.5. Plan today is to repeat her thyroid function studies. This case was discussed with Dr. X and the recommendation.

Needs patency assessment and tube optimization.\n\nImmediate management today\n- Ensure unobstructed drainage:\n  - Empty/replace the right drainage bag immediately; keep bag below kidney level at all times; eliminate dependent loops/kinks.\n  - Inspect/replace connectors and secure the tube (adhesive device/suture) to prevent traction.\n  - Change to a dry sterile dressing; reinforce if damp.\n- Labs:\n  - BMP (Cr, BUN, K, CO2, Na), CBC.\n  - Urinalysis and urine culture from each nephrostomy (obtain aseptically from sampling port), given high colonization rates with long-term PCNs.\n- If output remains low from right tube or leakage persists after bag change and line check, keep NPO after midnight and proceed with planned IR evaluation.\n\nPlanned procedure (Interventional Radiology \u2013 tomorrow 10 a.m.)\n- Right nephrostogram to assess catheter position and collecting system patency.\n- Exchange/upsize right PCN (e.g., 8 Fr to 10\u201312 Fr) and secure; replace tubing and drainage bag.\n- Consideration by IR/urology for:\n  - Nephroureteral stent or internal ureteral stent if feasible for longer-term management/quality of life.\n- Per IR protocol:\n  - Check creatinine and coagulation parameters if sedation anticipated.\n  - Antibiotic prophylaxis: single peri-procedural dose may be given due to high colonization rates; treat only if symptomatic or culture-directed infection.\n  - Contrast allergy screening (contrast is instilled via tube; systemic absorption is limited).\n\nInfection monitoring\n- No empiric antibiotics now (afebrile, benign exam). Start antibiotics only if fever, leukocytosis, flank pain, or positive culture with symptoms develop.\n\nKidney/oncology management\n- Avoid nephrotoxins (NSAIDs, unnecessary IV contrast).\n- Ensure good hydration unless contraindicated by cardiopulmonary status.\n- Nephrology follow-up to trend renal function post-exchange.\n- Urology/oncology follow-up for ongoing management of malignant obstruction and prostate cancer.\n- Plan routine",

There was no consultation dictated for this and no name was mentioned in the discharge summary, paged Dr. X as this was the only name that the patient could remember that might have been involved with the placement of the nephrostomy tubes. Dr. A responded to the page and recommended __________ off a BMP and discussing it with Dr. B, the radiologist as he recalled that this was the physician who placed the nephrostomy tubes, paged Dr. X and received a call back from Dr. X. Dr. X stated that he would have somebody get in touch with us about scheduling a time for which they will change out the nephrostomy tube to a larger and check a nephrogram at that time that came down and stated that they would do it at 10 a.m. tomorrow. This was discussed with the patient and instructions to return to the hospital at 10 a.m. to have this tube changed out by Dr. X was explained and understood.DIAGNOSES:1.

          "text": "Medical Specialty:Neurology\nSample Name:\u00a0Consult - Alzheimer disease\nDescription:\u00a0Patient with a history of mesothelioma and likely mild dementia, most likely Alzheimer type.\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\nThe patient states that she has been having some problems with her memory for maybe the past year or two. She states that they have been slowly progressive. She had a consultation with an outside neurologist and was told that she likely has Alzheimer disease and was prescribed Aricept and was told that she should not drive. Per the dictation that is available to us in clinic, it appears that she was before a DMV. It appears that the patient wanted a second opinion, so she now presents for consultation on possible Alzheimer disease.The patient states that she has been doing fairly well at home. She balances her own checkbook. She does not do her own taxes, but she has never done so in the past. She states that she has no problems with cooking meals, getting her own meals, and she is still currently driving. She denies burning any dishes because she forgot them on the stove or forgetting what she is doing in the middle of a task or getting lost while she is driving around or getting lost in her own home. She states that she is very good remembering the names of her family members and does not forget important birthdays such as the date of birth of her grandchildren. She is unfortunately living alone, and although she seems to miss her grandchildren and is estranged from her son, she denies any symptoms of frank depression. There is unfortunately no one available to us to corroborate how well she is doing at home. She lives alone and takes care of herself and does not communicate very much with her brother and sister. She also does not communicate very much with her son who lives in Santa Cruz or her grandchildren. She denied any sort of personality change, paranoid ideas or hallucinations. She does appear to have headaches that can be severe about four times a month and have primarily photophobia and some nausea and occasionally emesis associated with it. When these headaches are very severe, she goes to the emergency room to get a single shot. She is unclear if this is some sort of a migraine medication or just a primary pain medication. She takes Fiorinal for these headaches and she states that this helps greatly. She denies visual or migraine symptoms.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for any sort of focal neurologic deficits such as weakness, numbness, visual changes, dysarthria, diplopia or dysphagia. She also denies any sort of movement disorders, tremors, rigidities or clonus. Her personal opinion is that some of her memory problems may be due to simply to her age and/or nervousness. She is unclear as if her memory is any worse than anyone else in her age group.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for mesothelioma, which was diagnosed seemingly more than 20 to 25 years ago. The patient was not sure of exactly when it was diagnosed. This has been treated surgically by debulking operations for which she states that she has undergone about 10 operations. The mesothelioma is in her abdomen. She does not know of any history of having lung mesothelioma. She states that she has never gotten chemotherapy or radiation for her mesothelioma. Furthermore, she states that her last surgical debulking was more than 10 years ago and her disease has been fairly stable. She does have a history of three car accidents that she says were all rear-enders where she was hit while essentially in a stopped position. These have all occurred over the past five years. She also has a diagnosis of dementing illness, possibly Alzheimer disease from her previous neurology consultation. This diagnosis was given in March 2006.MEDICATIONS: Fiorinal, p.r.n. aspirin, unclear if baby or full sized, Premarin unclear of the dose.\nALLERGIES: NONE.SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for her being without a companion at this point. She was born in Munich, Germany. She immigrated to of America in 1957 after her family had to move to Eastern Germany, which was under Russian occupation at that time. She is divorced. She used to work as a secretary and later worked as a clerical worker at IBM. She stopped working more than 20 years ago due to complications from her mesothelioma. She denies any significant tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs. She is bilingual speaking, German and English. She has known English from before her teens. She has the equivalent of a high school education in Germany. She has one brother and one sister, both of whom are healthy and she does not spend much time communicating with them. She has one son who lives in Santa Cruz. He has grandchildren. She is trying to contact with her grandchildren.FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for lung, liver, and prostate cancer. Her mother died in her 80s of \"old age,\" but it appears that she may have had a mild dementing illness at that time. Whatever that dementing illness was, appears to have started mostly in her 80s per the patient. No one else appears to have Alzheimer disease including her brother and sister.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 152/92, pulse 80, and weight 80.7 kg. She is alert and well nourished in no apparent distress. She occasionally fumbles with questions of orientation, missing the day and the date. She also did not know the name of the hospital, she thought it was O'Connor and she thought she was in Orange County and also did not know the floor of the hospital that we are in. She lost three points for recall. Even with prompting, she could not remember the objects that she was given to remember. Her Mini Mental Score was 22/30. There were no naming problems or problems with repetition. There were also no signs of dysarthria. Her pupils were bilaterally reactive to light and accommodation. Her extraocular movements were intact. Her visual fields were full to confrontation. Her sensations of her face, arm, and leg were normal. There were no signs of neglect with double simultaneous stimulation. Tongue was midline. Her palate was symmetric. Her face was symmetric as well. Strength was approximately 5/5. She did have some right knee pain and she had a mildly antalgic gait due to her right knee pain. Her reflexes were symmetric and +2 except for her toes, which were +1 to trace. Her plantar reflexes were mute. Her sensation was normal for pain, temperature, and vibration. There were no signs of ataxia on finger-to-nose and there was no dysdiadochokinesia. Gait was narrow and she could toe walk briefly and heel walk without difficulty.SUMMARY: Ms. A is a pleasant 72-year-old right-handed woman with a history of mesothelioma that appears stable at this time and likely mild dementia, most likely Alzheimer type. We tactfully discussed the patient's diagnosis with her, and she felt reassured. We told her that this most likely was in the earlier stages of disease and she would benefit from trying Aricept. She stated that she did not have the prescription anymore from her outpatient neurology consult for the Aricept, so we wrote her another prescription for Aricept. The patient herself seemed very concerned about the stigma of the disease, but our lengthy discussion, expressed genuine understanding as to why her outpatient physician had reported her to DMV. It was explicitly told to not drive by her outpatient neurologist and we concur with this assessment. She will follow up with us in the next six months and will call us if she has any problems with the Aricept. She was written for Aricept to start at 5 mg for three weeks, and if she has no side effects which typically are GI side effects, then she can go up to 10 mg a day. We also reviewed with Ms. A the findings for outpatient MRI, which showed some mild atrophy per report and also that her metabolic workup, which included an RPR, TSH, and B12 were all within normal limits.\nKeywords:\u00a0neurology, neurology consultation, dementing illness, alzheimer disease, dementia, alzheimer, mesothelioma,"

She denies burning any dishes because she forgot them on the stove or forgetting what she is doing in the middle of a task or getting lost while she is driving around or getting lost in her own home. She states that she is very good remembering the names of her family members and does not forget important birthdays such as the date of birth of her grandchildren. She is unfortunately living alone, and although she seems to miss her grandchildren and is estranged from her son, she denies any symptoms of frank depression. There is unfortunately no one available to us to corroborate how well she is doing at home. She lives alone and takes care of herself and does not communicate very much with her brother and sister. She also does not communicate very much with her son who lives in Santa Cruz or her grandchildren. She denied any sort of personality change, paranoid ideas or hallucinations. She does appear to have headaches that can be severe about four times a month and have primarily photophobia and some nausea and occasionally emesis associated with it. When these headaches are very severe, she goes to the emergency room to get a single shot. She is unclear if this is some sort of a migraine medication or just a primary pain medication. She takes Fiorinal for these headaches and she states that this helps greatly. She denies visual or migraine symptoms.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for any sort of focal neurologic deficits such as weakness, numbness, visual changes, dysarthria, diplopia or dysphagia. She also denies any sort of movement disorders, tremors, rigidities or clonus. Her personal opinion is that some of her memory problems may be due to simply to her age and/or nervousness. She is unclear as if her memory is any worse than anyone else in her age group.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for mesothelioma, which was diagnosed seemingly more than 20 to 25 years ago. The patient was not sure of exactly when it was diagnosed. This has been treated surgically by debulking operations for which she states that she has undergone about 10 operations. The mesothelioma is in her abdomen. She does not know of any history of having lung mesothelioma. She states that she has never gotten chemotherapy or radiation for her mesothelioma. Furthermore, she states that her last surgical debulking was more than 10 years ago and her disease has been fairly stable. She does have a history of three car accidents that she says were all rear-enders where she was hit while essentially in a stopped position. These have all occurred over the past five years. She also has a diagnosis of dementing illness, possibly Alzheimer disease from her previous neurology consultation. This diagnosis was given in March 2006.MEDICATIONS: Fiorinal, p.r.n. aspirin, unclear if baby or full sized, Premarin unclear of the dose.\nALLERGIES: NONE.SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for her being without a companion at this point. She was born in Munich, Germany. She immigrated to of America in 1957 after her family had to move to Eastern Germany, which was under Russian occupation at that time. She is divorced. She used to work as a secretary and later worked as a clerical worker at IBM. She stopped working more than 20 years ago due to complications from her mesothelioma. She denies any significant tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs. She is bilingual speaking, German and English. She has known English from before her teens. She has the equivalent of a high school education in Germany. She has one brother and one sister, both of whom are healthy and she does not spend much time communicating with them. She has one son who lives in Santa Cruz. He has grandchildren. She is trying to contact with her grandchildren.FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for lung, liver, and prostate cancer. Her mother died in her 80s of \"old age,\" but it appears that she may have had a mild dementing illness at that time. Whatever that dementing illness was, appears to have started mostly in her 80s per the patient. No one else appears to have Alzheimer disease including her brother and sister.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 152/92, pulse 80, and weight 80.7 kg. She is alert and well nourished in no apparent distress. She occasionally fumbles with questions of orientation, missing the day and the date. She also did not know the name of the hospital, she thought it was O'Connor and she thought she was in Orange County and also did not know the floor of the hospital that we are in. She lost three points for recall. Even with prompting, she could not remember the objects that she was given to remember. Her Mini Mental Score was 22/30. There were no naming problems or problems with repetition. There were also no signs of dysarthria. Her pupils were bilaterally reactive to light and accommodation. Her extraocular movements were intact. Her visual fields were full to confrontation. Her sensations of her face, arm, and leg were normal. There were no signs of neglect with double simultaneous stimulation. Tongue was midline. Her palate was symmetric. Her face was symmetric as well. Strength was approximately 5/5. She did have some right knee pain and she had a mildly antalgic gait due to her right knee pain. Her reflexes were symmetric and +2 except for her toes, which were +1 to trace. Her plantar reflexes were mute. Her sensation was normal for pain, temperature, and vibration. There were no signs of ataxia on finger-to-nose and there was no dysdiadochokinesia. Gait was narrow and she could toe walk briefly and heel walk without difficulty.SUMMARY: Ms. A is a pleasant 72-year-old right-handed woman with a history of mesothelioma that appears stable at this time and likely mild dementia, most likely Alzheimer type. We tactfully discussed the patient's diagnosis with her, and she felt reassured. We told her that this most likely was in the earlier stages of disease and she would benefit from trying Aricept. She stated that she did not have the prescription anymore from her outpatient neurology consult for the Aricept, so we wrote her another prescription for Aricept. The patient herself seemed very concerned about the stigma of the disease, but our lengthy discussion, expressed genuine understanding as to why her outpatient physician had reported her to DMV. It was explicitly told to not drive by her outpatient neurologist and we concur with this assessment. She will follow up with us in the next six months and will call us if she has any problems with the Aricept. She was written for Aricept to start at 5 mg for three weeks, and if she has no side effects which typically are GI side effects, then she can go up to 10 mg a day. We also reviewed with Ms. A the findings for outpatient MRI, which showed some mild atrophy per report and also that her metabolic workup, which included an RPR, TSH, and B12 were all within normal limits.\nKeywords:\u00a0neurology, neurology consultation, dementing illness, alzheimer disease, dementia, alzheimer, mesothelioma,\nAnswer:",

On aspirin (dose unclear) and Premarin.\n\nPlan:\n\n1) Cognitive disorder \u2013 probable Alzheimer disease (mild stage)\n- Pharmacologic:\n  - Start/continue donepezil (Aricept) 5 mg daily for 3\u20134 weeks, then increase to 10 mg daily if tolerated.\n  - Counsel on adverse effects: nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, vivid dreams, cramps, bradycardia/syncope. If insomnia/vivid dreams occur, switch dosing to morning.\n  - If intolerant, consider rivastigmine patch or galantamine. Consider adding memantine later when disease progresses to moderate stage.\n  - Avoid anticholinergic and sedating medications that worsen cognition (e.g., diphenhydramine, amitriptyline, oxybutynin; minimize butalbital).\n- Baseline/monitoring:\n  - Check resting pulse/orthostatics; consider baseline ECG if history of syncope, bradycardia, or conduction disease.\n  - Establish cognitive baseline with MoCA or formal neuropsychological testing; repeat in 6\u201312 months.\n- Nonpharmacologic:\n  - Cognitive stimulation and routine structure; encourage MIND/Mediterranean diet, regular aerobic exercise, social engagement, sleep optimization, and hearing/vision correction.\n  - Screen and treat depression/anxiety; consider referral for counseling if isolation persists.\n\n2) Safety and functional supports\n- Driving: Do not drive. Reinforce prior instruction and reporting to DMV. If contested, arrange a formal occupational therapy\u2013based driving evaluation; until then, no driving.\n- Home safety: Occupational therapy/home safety evaluation; use pill organizers/automated dispensers; consider stove auto shut-off devices; establish regular check-ins (family, neighbors, community services).\n- Care planning",

          "prompt_text": "You are a medical expert responsible for evaluating a proposed treatment plan\nbased on provided patient information.\n\nYour goal is to assess whether the treatment plan uses the patient's medical history,\nmedications, symptoms, and other relevant details appropriately, follows clinical best practices,\nand aligns with the gold standard response in accuracy, completeness, and clarity.\n\nThe patient's information will be provided in these tags:\n<patient_information>\nMedical Specialty:Neurology\nSample Name:\u00a0Consult - Alzheimer disease\nDescription:\u00a0Patient with a history of mesothelioma and likely mild dementia, most likely Alzheimer type.\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\nThe patient states that she has been having some problems with her memory for maybe the past year or two. She states that they have been slowly progressive. She had a consultation with an outside neurologist and was told that she likely has Alzheimer disease and was prescribed Aricept and was told that she should not drive. Per the dictation that is available to us in clinic, it appears that she was before a DMV. It appears that the patient wanted a second opinion, so she now presents for consultation on possible Alzheimer disease.The patient states that she has been doing fairly well at home. She balances her own checkbook. She does not do her own taxes, but she has never done so in the past. She states that she has no problems with cooking meals, getting her own meals, and she is still currently driving. She denies burning any dishes because she forgot them on the stove or forgetting what she is doing in the middle of a task or getting lost while she is driving around or getting lost in her own home. She states that she is very good remembering the names of her family members and does not forget important birthdays such as the date of birth of her grandchildren. She is unfortunately living alone, and although she seems to miss her grandchildren and is estranged from her son, she denies any symptoms of frank depression. There is unfortunately no one available to us to corroborate how well she is doing at home. She lives alone and takes care of herself and does not communicate very much with her brother and sister. She also does not communicate very much with her son who lives in Santa Cruz or her grandchildren. She denied any sort of personality change, paranoid ideas or hallucinations. She does appear to have headaches that can be severe about four times a month and have primarily photophobia and some nausea and occasionally emesis associated with it. When these headaches are very severe, she goes to the emergency room to get a single shot. She is unclear if this is some sort of a migraine medication or just a primary pain medication. She takes Fiorinal for these headaches and she states that this helps greatly. She denies visual or migraine symptoms.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for any sort of focal neurologic deficits such as weakness, numbness, visual changes, dysarthria, diplopia or dysphagia. She also denies any sort of movement disorders, tremors, rigidities or clonus. Her personal opinion is that some of her memory problems may be due to simply to her age and/or nervousness. She is unclear as if her memory is any worse than anyone else in her age group.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for mesothelioma, which was diagnosed seemingly more than 20 to 25 years ago. The patient was not sure of exactly when it was diagnosed. This has been treated surgically by debulking operations for which she states that she has undergone about 10 operations. The mesothelioma is in her abdomen. She does not know of any history of having lung mesothelioma. She states that she has never gotten chemotherapy or radiation for her mesothelioma. Furthermore, she states that her last surgical debulking was more than 10 years ago and her disease has been fairly stable. She does have a history of three car accidents that she says were all rear-enders where she was hit while essentially in a stopped position. These have all occurred over the past five years. She also has a diagnosis of dementing illness, possibly Alzheimer disease from her previous neurology consultation. This diagnosis was given in March 2006.MEDICATIONS: Fiorinal, p.r.n. aspirin, unclear if baby or full sized, Premarin unclear of the dose.\nALLERGIES: NONE.SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for her being without a companion at this point. She was born in Munich, Germany. She immigrated to of America in 1957 after her family had to move to Eastern Germany, which was under Russian occupation at that time. She is divorced. She used to work as a secretary and later worked as a clerical worker at IBM. She stopped working more than 20 years ago due to complications from her mesothelioma. She denies any significant tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs. She is bilingual speaking, German and English. She has known English from before her teens. She has the equivalent of a high school education in Germany. She has one brother and one sister, both of whom are healthy and she does not spend much time communicating with them. She has one son who lives in Santa Cruz. He has grandchildren. She is trying to contact with her grandchildren.FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for lung, liver, and prostate cancer. Her mother died in her 80s of \"old age,\" but it appears that she may have had a mild dementing illness at that time. Whatever that dementing illness was, appears to have started mostly in her 80s per the patient. No one else appears to have Alzheimer disease including her brother and sister.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 152/92, pulse 80, and weight 80.7 kg. She is alert and well nourished in no apparent distress. She occasionally fumbles with questions of orientation, missing the day and the date. She also did not know the name of the hospital, she thought it was O'Connor and she thought she was in Orange County and also did not know the floor of the hospital that we are in. She lost three points for recall. Even with prompting, she could not remember the objects that she was given to remember. Her Mini Mental Score was 22/30. There were no naming problems or problems with repetition. There were also no signs of dysarthria. Her pupils were bilaterally reactive to light and accommodation. Her extraocular movements were intact. Her visual fields were full to confrontation. Her sensations of her face, arm, and leg were normal. There were no signs of neglect with double simultaneous stimulation. Tongue was midline. Her palate was symmetric. Her face was symmetric as well. Strength was approximately 5/5. She did have some right knee pain and she had a mildly antalgic gait due to her right knee pain. Her reflexes were symmetric and +2 except for her toes, which were +1 to trace. Her plantar reflexes were mute. Her sensation was normal for pain, temperature, and vibration. There were no signs of ataxia on finger-to-nose and there was no dysdiadochokinesia. Gait was narrow and she could toe walk briefly and heel walk without difficulty.SUMMARY: Ms. A is a pleasant 72-year-old right-handed woman with a history of mesothelioma that appears stable at this time and likely mild dementia, most likely Alzheimer type. We tactfully discussed the patient's diagnosis with her, and she felt reassured. We told her that this most likely was in the earlier stages of disease and she would benefit from trying Aricept. She stated that she did not have the prescription anymore from her outpatient neurology consult for the Aricept, so we wrote her another prescription for Aricept. The patient herself seemed very concerned about the stigma of the disease, but our lengthy discussion, expressed genuine understanding as to why her outpatient physician had reported her to DMV. It was explicitly told to not drive by her outpatient neurologist and we concur with this assessment. She will follow up with us in the next six months and will call us if she has any problems with the Aricept. She was written for Aricept to start at 5 mg for three weeks, and if she has no side effects which typically are GI side effects, then she can go up to 10 mg a day. We also reviewed with Ms. A the findings for outpatient MRI, which showed some mild atrophy per report and also that her metabolic workup, which included an RPR, TSH, and B12 were all within normal limits.\nKeywords:\u00a0neurology, neurology consultation, dementing illness, alzheimer disease, dementia, alzheimer, mesothelioma,\n</patient_information>\n\nThe proposed treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nTreatment plan (Neurology \u2013 probable mild Alzheimer disease with comorbid headaches and hypertension)\n\nAssessment highlights:\n- 72-year-old woman with progressive memory and orientation deficits (MMSE 22/30), MRI with mild atrophy, labs (TSH, B12, RPR) normal \u2192 probable mild Alzheimer disease.\n- Lives alone; limited collateral; currently still driving despite prior physician advising against.\n- Recurrent severe headaches (~4/month) with photophobia, nausea \u2192 likely migraine; currently uses butalbital/aspirin/caffeine (Fiorinal) and occasional ED injections.\n- Elevated blood pressure (152/92).

A V/Q scan revealed multiple pulmonary perfusion defects consistent with high probability pulmonary embolism. A Doppler venous study of the lower extremity also revealed nonocclusive right popliteal vein thrombosis. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed normal-appearing liver, spleen, and pancreas; however, the right kidney appeared smaller compared to left and suggesting possibility of renal infarct. Renal function on admission was within normal range; however, serial renal function showed rapid increase in creatinine to 5 today. He has been on intravenous heparin and hemodialysis is being planned for tomorrow. Reviewing his history, there is no family members with hypercoagulable state or prior history of any thrombotic complication. He denies any recent injury to his lower extremity and in fact denied any calf pain or swelling.PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY: Unremarkable.SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married and has 1 son. He has a brother who is healthy. There is no history of tobacco use or alcohol use.FAMILY HISTORY: No family history of hypercoagulable condition.\nMEDICATIONS: Advil p.r.n.ALLERGIES:  NONE.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Essentially unremarkable except for sudden onset dyspnea on easy exertion complicated with episode of syncope. He denied any hemoptysis. He denied any calf swelling or pain. Lately, he has been traveling and has been sitting behind a desk for a long period of time.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:GENERAL: He is a robust young gentleman, awake, alert, and hemodynamically stable.HEENT: Sclerae anicteric. Conjunctivae normal. Oropharynx normal.NECK: No adenopathy or thyromegaly. No jugular venous distention.\nHEART: Regular.LUNGS: Bilateral air entry.ABDOMEN: Obese and benign.EXTREMITIES: No calf swelling or calf tenderness appreciated.SKIN: No petechiae or ecchymosis.NEUROLOGIC: Nonfocal.LABORATORY FINDINGS: Blood count obtained showed a white count of 16.8, hemoglobin 14.8 g percent, hematocrit 44.6%, MCV 94, and platelet count 209,000. Liver profile normal. Thyroid study revealed a TSH of 1.3. Prothrombin time/INR 1.5, partial thromboplastin time 78.6 seconds. Renal function, BUN 44 and creatinine 5.7. Echocardiogram revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with ejection fraction of 65%, no intramural thrombus noted.IMPRESSION:\n1. Bilateral pulmonary embolism, most consistent with emboli from right lower extremity, on intravenous heparin, rule out hereditary hypercoagulable state.2. Leukocytosis, most likely leukemoid reaction secondary to acute pulmonary embolism/renal infarction, doubt presence of myeloproliferative disorder.3. Acute renal failure secondary to embolic right renal infarction.4. Obesity.\n</patient_information>\n\nThe proposed treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nTreatment Plan\n\nProblem list\n- Acute bilateral pulmonary emboli with right popliteal DVT\n- Acute kidney injury, likely from renal infarction vs contrast-associated nephropathy\n- Leukocytosis (likely stress/leukemoid reaction)\n- Obesity\n\nImmediate management (inpatient)\n- Anticoagulation\n  - Continue intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) as first-line in severe AKI/dialysis setting.\n  - Titrate using anti-Xa levels (goal 0.3\u20130.7 IU/mL) or aPTT per hospital protocol; current aPTT 78.6 s is acceptable if within therapeutic range for protocol.\n  - Monitor CBC daily; watch for hemoglobin drop and for HIT (check platelets daily days 4\u201314 or until UFH stopped; calculate 4T score if platelets fall \u226550% or new thrombosis occurs).\n  - Hold UFH 2\u20134 hours pre-procedure for dialysis catheter placement; resume promptly afterward if hemostasis secured. Coordinate anticoagulation strategy with nephrology for dialysis sessions (consider regional citrate anticoagulation if needed to avoid excess systemic anticoagulation).\n\n- Thrombolysis/IVC filter\n  - No thrombolysis indicated: hemodynamically stable, no RV failure reported.\n  - No IVC filter at this time since he can be anticoagulated. Consider only if a contraindication to anticoagulation arises or proven recurrent PE despite therapeutic anticoagulation.\n\nRenal failure management (with Nephrology)\n- Proceed with dialysis as clinically indicated; avoid further iodinated contrast if possible.\n- Renally dose all medications; avoid nephrotoxins (especially NSAIDs\u2014stop Advil; use acetaminophen up to 3 g/day if liver function normal).\n- Monitor daily BMP, urine output, volume status; correct electrolytes and acid-base disturbances.\n- Renal imaging: no urgent intervention for suspected renal infarct given timing and stability; manage with systemic anticoagulation. Consider non-contrast MR/US follow-up if needed once stable.\n\nTransition and duration of anticoagulation\n- Bridge to warfarin once clinically stable:\n  - Start warfarin (e.g., 5 mg nightly; adjust to INR). Continue UFH overlap for at least 5 days AND until INR 2.0\n</response>\n\nThe gold standard treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\nFrom hematologic standpoint, we will await hypercoagulable studies, which have all been sent on admission to see if a hereditary component is at play. For now, we will continue intravenous heparin and subsequent oral anticoagulation with Coumadin. In view of worsening renal function, may need temporary hemodialysis until renal function improves. I discussed at length with the patient's wife at the bedside.\n</gold_response>\n\nCarefully review the <response> based on the <patient_information> and compare it to the <gold_response> when needed.\n\nFor each category below, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent) and\nprovide a brief explanation for your score:\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\nAccuracy (1-5)\n- Does the treatment plan provide correct medical advice based on clinical guidelines?\n\nCompleteness (1-5)\nDoes the treatment plan include all important medical details?\n\nClarity (1-5)\n- Is the treatment plan written clearly so clinicians can easily understand it?\n\nOutput Format:\nGenerate a valid JSON object with the following structure:\n{\n    \"accuracy\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"completeness\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"score\": 0,\n        \"explanation\": \"Explain why this score was given.\"\n    }\n}\n\nEnsure the output is valid JSON:\n- Use **double quotes** (\") for all keys and string values.\n- When quoting text or sections inside the explanations, use escaped double quotes (\") to\n  maintain valid JSON formatting.\n- Do not include any additional information in the output.\n"

            "text": "Assessment:\n- Low-intermediate risk profile. Good exercise capacity (10.1 METs), adequate heart rate response, normal blood pressure response.\n- Mild exercise ECG changes (0.5 mm ST depression) with chest pain during exertion but normal nuclear myocardial perfusion and normal LV function (EF 68%) suggest no significant inducible ischemia. Findings are most consistent with a false-positive ECG, noncardiac chest pain, or possible microvascular/vasospastic angina rather than obstructive epicardial CAD.\n\nTreatment Plan:\n1) Education and activity\n- Reassurance: Normal perfusion and EF indicate low short-term risk for MI.\n- Resume/continue regular physical activity as tolerated; consider a graded exercise plan.\n- Keep a symptom diary noting triggers, duration, and response to rest/medications.\n\n2) Medications (symptom-directed, considering resting BP ~100/60)\n- Nitroglycerin 0.3\u20130.4 mg sublingual as needed for chest pain; may repeat every 5 minutes up to 3 doses. Use while seated/lying due to low baseline BP. If pain persists after 1 dose or is severe/prolonged, call emergency services.\n- Daily antianginal therapy is not routinely needed with normal imaging; if exertional chest pain persists or limits activity, discuss:\n  - Low-dose beta-blocker (e.g., metoprolol succinate) titrated cautiously to symptoms/heart rate, monitoring for hypotension; OR\n  - If vasospasm suspected (rest/nighttime pain, cold exposure triggers), a calcium channel blocker (e.g., diltiazem or amlodipine) may be preferred; avoid nonselective beta-blockers in pure vasospastic angina.\n  - Consider ranolazine if symptoms persist and BP limits other agents.\n- Avoid routine aspirin for primary prevention unless 10-year ASCVD risk is high and bleeding risk is low; not indicated solely based on these test results.\n\n3) Risk factor assessment and modification\n- Check/optimize: fasting lipid panel, A1c, blood pressure trend, smoking status, BMI, physical activity, sleep apnea symptoms.\n- Lipids: Initiate statin per ACC/AHA guidelines based on ASCVD risk. If risk is borderline/uncertain, consider coronary artery calcium scoring to guide statin decision.\n- Lifestyle: Mediterranean-style diet, regular aerobic exercise (\ufffd\ufffd150 min/",

Chest pain resolved after termination of exercise. Good exercise duration, tolerance and double product. Normal nuclear myocardial perfusion scan.\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\nINDICATION: Chest pain.INTERPRETATION:  Resting heart rate of 71, blood pressure 100/60. EKG normal sinus rhythm. The patient exercised on Bruce for 8 minutes on stage III. Peak heart rate was 151, which is 87% of the target heart rate, blood pressure of 132/54. Total METs was 10.1. EKG revealed nonspecific ST depression in inferior and lateral leads. The test was terminated because of fatigue. The patient did have chest pain during exercise that resolved after termination of the exercise.IN SUMMARY:1. Positive exercise ischemia with ST depression 0.5 mm.2. Chest pain resolved after termination of exercise.3. Good exercise duration, tolerance and double product.NUCLEAR INTERPRETATION:\nResting and stress images were obtained with 10.1 mCi and 34.1 mCi of tetraphosphate injected intravenously by standard protocol. Nuclear myocardial perfusion scan demonstrates homogenous and uniform distribution with tracer uptake without any evidence of reversible or fixed defect. Gated SPECT revealed normal wall motion, ejection fraction of 68%. End-diastolic volume of 77, end-systolic volume of 24.IN SUMMARY:1. Normal nuclear myocardial perfusion scan.2. Ejection fraction of 68% by gated SPECT.\nKeywords:\u00a0cardiovascular / pulmonary, chest pain, ekg, sinus, st depression, mci, gated spect, nuclear myocardial perfusion scan, ejection fraction, myocardial perfusion, perfusion scan, heart rate, spect, stress, nuclear, chest,\n</patient_information>\n\nThe proposed treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<response>\nAssessment:\n- Low-intermediate risk profile. Good exercise capacity (10.1 METs), adequate heart rate response, normal blood pressure response.\n- Mild exercise ECG changes (0.5 mm ST depression) with chest pain during exertion but normal nuclear myocardial perfusion and normal LV function (EF 68%) suggest no significant inducible ischemia. Findings are most consistent with a false-positive ECG, noncardiac chest pain, or possible microvascular/vasospastic angina rather than obstructive epicardial CAD.\n\nTreatment Plan:\n1) Education and activity\n- Reassurance: Normal perfusion and EF indicate low short-term risk for MI.\n- Resume/continue regular physical activity as tolerated; consider a graded exercise plan.\n- Keep a symptom diary noting triggers, duration, and response to rest/medications.\n\n2) Medications (symptom-directed, considering resting BP ~100/60)\n- Nitroglycerin 0.3\u20130.4 mg sublingual as needed for chest pain; may repeat every 5 minutes up to 3 doses. Use while seated/lying due to low baseline BP. If pain persists after 1 dose or is severe/prolonged, call emergency services.\n- Daily antianginal therapy is not routinely needed with normal imaging; if exertional chest pain persists or limits activity, discuss:\n  - Low-dose beta-blocker (e.g., metoprolol succinate) titrated cautiously to symptoms/heart rate, monitoring for hypotension; OR\n  - If vasospasm suspected (rest/nighttime pain, cold exposure triggers), a calcium channel blocker (e.g., diltiazem or amlodipine) may be preferred; avoid nonselective beta-blockers in pure vasospastic angina.\n  - Consider ranolazine if symptoms persist and BP limits other agents.\n- Avoid routine aspirin for primary prevention unless 10-year ASCVD risk is high and bleeding risk is low; not indicated solely based on these test results.\n\n3) Risk factor assessment and modification\n- Check/optimize: fasting lipid panel, A1c, blood pressure trend, smoking status, BMI, physical activity, sleep apnea symptoms.\n- Lipids: Initiate statin per ACC/AHA guidelines based on ASCVD risk. If risk is borderline/uncertain, consider coronary artery calcium scoring to guide statin decision.\n- Lifestyle: Mediterranean-style diet, regular aerobic exercise (\ufffd\ufffd150 min/\n</response>\n\nThe gold standard treatment plan will be provided in these tags:\n<gold_response>\n1.

Desires to continue pregnancy if ongoing.\n- On SSRI (escitalopram). Tramadol co-ingestion increases risk of seizures and serotonin toxicity.\n- History of gastric bypass with prior diabetes resolved; higher risk of micronutrient deficiencies.\n- Social stressors; acute safety risk.\n\nPlan\n1) Immediate medical stabilization/overdose management\n- Place on continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring; frequent vitals and neuro checks.\n- Establish IV access; give isotonic IV fluids for tachycardia/dehydration.\n- Labs now: CBC, CMP, magnesium, phosphorus, venous blood gas if indicated, serum glucose, quantitative hCG, type and screen, serum acetaminophen and salicylate levels, ethanol level, urine tox screen, UA. Check creatine kinase if agitation/seizures develop.\n- 12-lead ECG; repeat if symptoms/QTc abnormal.\n- Consult Poison Control/toxicology for co-ingestion guidance.\n- Decontamination: consider single-dose activated charcoal if ingestion <2 hours and airway is protected.
