She says that his first seizure occurred 1 year ago. Since then, he has been on valproic acid but the seizure activity remains unchanged. He was recently enrolled in daycare because she could no longer care for him full-time. Since then, the seizure activity has increased and the daycare facility also noted concerns over his lack of response to voice commands. Family history is significant for a cousin who died suddenly at a young age. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 105/52 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 25/min. A physical exam is significant for lack of response to auditory stimulation. An EEG is performed, which is unrevealing. An ECG is shown in Figure A. The patient is then startled when a door is closed quickly and he suddenly loses consciousness. An ECG is quickly performed and is shown in Figure B. An electrolyte panel is drawn with the following findings:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 142 mEq/L\nCl-: 88 mEq/dL\nK+: 3.4 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nBUN: 11 mg/dL\nGlucose: 67 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 0.6 mg/dL\nMg2+: 1.7 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?"

He is admitted to the medical intensive care unit for continuous electroencephalogram monitoring while on a midazolam infusion for seizure suppression and supportive care for his burn. Overnight, the nurse continued to increase the patient's midazolam infusion rate, but she also noticed that his left toes were cold to the touch with significant edema.

The patient has a medical history of asthma and his only medication is albuterol. His temperature is 98.0\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 17/min. Exam was significant for pulsatile bleeding from a clean-cut wound on his right second finger. Radiography of the hand revealed a complete amputation of the right finger from the distal interphalangeal joint. The wound was cleaned, compression applied, analgesics administered, and the hand surgeons were notified. The teacher states that he left the amputated finger in the classroom, but the principal would be transporting it to the hospital.
