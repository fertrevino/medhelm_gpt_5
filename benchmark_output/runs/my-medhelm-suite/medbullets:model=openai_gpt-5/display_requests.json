The patient has been breastfed since birth, and usually feeds for 30 minutes every 2-3 hours. The patient\u2019s mother is concerned that her milk production is not keeping up with the patient\u2019s nutritional requirements. She reports that about 2 weeks ago the patient began regurgitating breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds. He seems mildly upset during the episodes of regurgitation but usually settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards. His mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of regurgitation. She denies any diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. Her older son had a similar problem with vomiting that resolved around 12 months of age. Four weeks ago, the patient\u2019s height and weight were in the 40th and 34th percentiles, respectively.
